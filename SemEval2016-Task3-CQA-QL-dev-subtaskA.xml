			<RelCText>Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I was catching fish before on corniche and if i show you some of the photos you would not believe me. Now everything on Corniche is banned. No Fishing; No Playing Football; No Bikes; No setting on the grass and ... I don't know what is next. You can go to 'Khour El Edid' and see there. Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why there? I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.</RelCText>

The owner of the car has relocated to another country along with the car. 2. The purchase was done in Qatar but was not registered in Qatar. 3. The seller has authorised his shipping company to handle this transaction. 4.

			<RelCText>The one thing you can be certain of is that Cairo is not Doha!!! We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad (if you think Doha is bad...just wait) its actually comical. There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in. Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts. But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking. And yet; and yet; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha. It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself (not surprising given its ancient history). It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations. Egypt is a beguiling country which captured the heart of more than one roman emperor and many kings. Keep that in mind as you deal with the settling in period and once you .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for your responses. Celestvile; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery; I doubt it's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza; where my husband works. We shall see...we heard 6 October area is also nice? Besides; our housing allowance will only be $1500; which I think doesn't strech for a place in Maadi; and after living in a small flat for the last three years; I'm looking forward to a big place with a garden. By the way; do you have any idea where the french school is located? Dweller; oh god; now you worried me...with that kind of money I could live anywhere . Wonder why your son didn't like it. PM; yes I noticed that too (The $ sign); sounds like I will get ripped off quite often; then. So your friends dislike living in Cairo?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Please inform the United States Internal Revenue Service that there is no need to worry about taxes here. Someone keeps forgetting to inform them so they keep collecting taxes from US Citizen expats working all over the world. Check the US tax code and tell me where it says no taxes to be paid if you work in Qatar (or any other foreign country). I've heard this bunch of misinformation BS way too many times.

			<RelCText>For a skilled worker from philippines - the normal basic salary is ranging from QR 2;500 to 5;000 excluding housing and transpo allowances. For professionals - salary is ranging from QR 8;000 to 45;000 depending on the qualification and industry. I know some colleagues in oil &amp; gas; banking industry and investments are even receiving between QR 50k to 80k per month. So it all depends on your qualification and work experiences.

			<RelCText>Frankly speaking the salary offered to you is a meager one if Doha standard of living is concerned. For your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyals per month. Your personal needs is an additional cost of 200 riyals. So total you'll have a net salary of 2000 riyals or about 500 dlrs. Socializing is another strain in your pocket. But it's okay as long as you follow the good manners and right conduct of being a foreigner here. No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"45;000 per month should easily afford you a very lavish lifestyle i would think. 10;000 a month for housing probably won't get you the pool that you desire; housing is insanely expensive in this country. If you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into securing the type of residence you really want; like novita77 said i would think 15000QR would get you a very nice place. you would still have plenty of cash left over to ""live it up"" esp if they are also giving you a car allowance like you stated in your post. QP is a well respected company that hires many foreigners. As every job i highly recommend you get everything in writing and signed by both parties."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>NEXT STEP... I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation....Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move...Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any...Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job....</RelCText>

The report must be endorsed by the Qatari Embassy in the country of origin. In the USA; The embassy require that this reports (must Include finger pronts) should be: Notarized by Notary public (local) Notarized by Secreatry of State (state Level) Notarized by US Department of State Qatari Embassy It is a long process and Takes time.

			<RelCText>I totally agree with tg; Sometimes things happen and this is not unusual here in Qatar. I know many people who resigned from their jobs hoping they will get the visa quickly and took up to 4 months. I work at HMC; they have their own immigration section and yet still they got me a visa in 6 weeks!!!!! so DO NOT ever ever ever resign your job and stay home until you really see your visa number with your two eyes ;) Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here; so it is not a problem.

			<RelCText>If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here; now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example; in the US they don't do BCGs; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer; but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I went to 3 places... Hamad; Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while; and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance; I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week; so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first; so bring the baby's RP; birth certificate; etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance; I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid; he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area; my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when w....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi; As of my knowledge; The National health center @ Abu hamour responsible for medical tests (once entered into the country;used to go for medical)only not for vaccination. For vaccination u need green card for the kid; for that u have go to Health commision back side of Hamad hospital ( from sports R/A to Fire station R/A; take right turn from Fire station R/A) approaching 200 mts one very big building. But yesterday she asked me r u from india; then she told it's in other place;i.e opp to Aldana hotel near sana R/A; one more medical commission is there. But they will give green card only and after that u have to go to u r regular health center; they will give the registrastion no and vaccination timings details. note: for issuing green card they need previous vaccination history record from u r county. if u have any doubts call to medical commision near aldana hotel @ 4312054 Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first you will have to take the vaccination card from your country go to ministry of health; they will give you a qatari vaccination card; so you will be able to track easily what your kid took and what's remaining; and then you will be directed to the health centre near your resident address; this is free but the other option is the private hospitals and this will cost you depending on the vaccine from 200-500 QR and also you will need this vaccination card; also its asked for at admission to schools they ask for it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I didn't have any vaccinations before coming here from the Netherlands... Doctors also didn't advise me to take any.

			<RelCText>As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low.

			<RelCText>In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes; you'll definitely want a heater cos the build quality of the houses/apartments is atrocious. The cold air and wind will whistle through the poorly sealed windows and ill-fitting doors. JJ - I don't know which is worse; being trapped in Doha or going back to Dukhan ;-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. QAWS (shutting down end of September; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome); 2nd Chance Rescue; Cats in Qatar; and Qatar Veterinary Center. Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats. Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering; microchip and vaccination costs; and some are completely free. 2. Depending on the kind of cat and where you go; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming. More reputable places such as the big vets (Parkview &amp; QVC) will charge more. 3. Anywhere from 100-500QR depending on what you need done.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Grooming isn't really necessary unless you get a persian or long haired cat. Save yourself the money and hassle and get a short haired Arabian Mau. They're hearty cats and you won't have a lot of health problems with them which will cut down on Vet costs. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>A better and more deserving place to get a pup is from the Animal care centre - it used to be called 'Paws and Claws' - not sure what it is called now. We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house. When we got him; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused. I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came; rounded them up and shot the parents; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre. We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup. He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter. There are good vetinary clincs in Doha; but still it is a bit expensive. Even then; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle; hug and love. If things go rough in school and her friends and teachers are mean; the dog is someone she would try to confide in; althought is cannot speak back.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buying a dog/puppy for your daughter is a very big decision. You have to consider many things before you decide on something. We have got a Shiranian (ShihTzu+Pom) for our 3yr old son; believe it was a very good decision; both are very good pals now. Factors: How old is your daughter? If she is below 5 years; make sure she have a toy group; very quiet and playful puppy. If she is bigger may be you can get a bigger one. Because size and attitude of dog will matter Is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly? Get low shedding or no shedding dogs. Is she ready for responsibilities? Can she clean; groom your pet. If not; you should be ready to do it for her; so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet. Flat? Staying in a flat; then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbours dont complaint against you and regarding toilet training you dont have to worry; it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out. Use a crate initially to keep your pet and .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Unfortunately the animals sold at Souq Wagif are in miserable condition so you will pay 3 times what you paid for the dog just to get it healthy. I was in search of a Siamese cat and bought a kitten there it took 3 weeks of hourly care and lots of Vet bills to keep the animal alive. Its a shame the govt. does not close it down its a menace to animal lovers. So don't buy the puppy and as stated its too young as well.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I wouldn't reccoemnt buying any animals from the souq. They are seriously mistreated (you only have to go and see them kept in the cages and sprayed with water to see that) and by buying one of these animals you are only further encouraging the sellers to mistreat animals. As others have said; there are better places to get animals (such as any of the vets who always have animals for adoption either in the centre or advertised on the boards). Finally; please consider if you and your daughter are ready for a dog. I personally; wouldn't have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat. I do; however; have a cat. Dogs must be walked every day (even in the heat of summer);. What will you do if you go on annual leave? Dogs are more expensive to be looked after than cats because they need more attention. Are you ready to pay high vet bills if your pet gets sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day? If you are confident that you are ready for a dog; then I wish you and your daughter the b.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DOGS OR CATS FROM ANY SOUQS OR PET SHOPS! A 4 week old puppy should still be with it's mother. The chances are that if you take it home; you will get attached to it and then it will die. It's too young to be away from it's mum; it's too young to be vaccinated; it won't have had proper puppy formula or health treatments. Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs. They are normally sick; not vaccinated or too young. Some have diseases that can be passed to humans and you never know if the dog maybe belongs to somebody already and it has been stolen/found and sold to the pet shops. If you seriously want a dog and are ready for the committment for the next 15 years; please contact one of the animal rescue groups or adopt a pet from a family. And make sure that whatever animal you get - it must have been vaccinated and neutered.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.</RelCText>

I advice you to shop around the prices first ... there are few more tinting place next door to Johnson; one of them is V-kool. Maybe you can comparing prices before you decide. I did mine without asking the police clearance ... the guy in Johnson said in certain percentage of blackout you dont need a police clearance. Then few months later i saw a thread in QL saying that (i think this thread might be by Rock The Casbah) he did inspection and the police just ripped his window filmed saying that he have no police clearance.

Do some parents not care for the safety of their children or what????? There are so many accidents here and a child would fly through the front window should a car have an accident and most probably result in death.

			<RelCText>"in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books. I feel sorry for the kids who have these people as parents. But I guess it's just Social Darwinism in action.

			<RelCText>"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat SueÃ±o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats.

Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."</RelCText>

The rest of the family was there as well...how tragic...in time; the news spread of how a fellow classmate; a close friend to many; was not going to be able to walk and play ball. Others vowed to ""buckle up"" as we say in south Texas. They had learned a hard lesson. If this story helps even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts/car seats...it was worth sharing. The Good News: He went on to complete his degree from UT. I last heard he was in law school with hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in defending rights for the disabled."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"was perhaps 2 days ago. At the Traffic lights at Hyatt Plaza a vehicle over took me and pulled in front of me at the red lights. As i looked into the car in front i could see a child of no more than two years old asleep on the back shelf; facing the window. Even my daughter who is four said"" look at that silly baby"" Ive not seen a collsion yet where the backend of the vehicle and rear window hasnt been smashed.

			<RelCText>I go there almost every weekend; cause I plan to do some Kite There are broken glasses; bottles; tires; carpets; plastic bags everywhere; month of May is long gone. I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame.

			<RelCText>that everyone feels it is the job of expats to clean up this country and the role of the locals to trash it in the first place. I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think so. If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok. There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello there; as i do live in dukhan for quite long time; i don't recommend you camping at um bab beach. nothing serious about it but normally people don't camp there!plus safety wise your gonna be far away from dukhan if you need assistance.not good location too i guess around there to camp; but just wanted to let you know since you've asked; you could try further down dukhans beach after the beach house (after the QP sailing club)if you know what i mean good clean spots you could always find. anyways good luck mate have fun!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>I started planning for the weekend ahead of time :) A friend of mine suggested I go desert camping near Ghariah or Sealine for the weekened but not sure if I need a license for that.

			<RelCText>also Zekreet area is nice to camp out; if you drive from sealine resort to inland sea by the coastline (thru the dunes and not the dessert highway) there are a few nice camp spots as well witch are clean and not crowded later on the day. we tent to leave at midday from sealine resort do a bit offroading / dune bashing and then camp out with and have a dive in sea; some stay overnight as well (me included) you do need a real 4x4 tough to do so; for zekreet area a crossover will work fine</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.Â  Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in aÂ  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.Â  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.Â  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well..LP...understood but there are maybe's here in particular that desalination of seawater and brines within particular WHO regions and globally is a large and rapidly growing process for producing new drinking-water. There is a clear public health and environmental protection argument for providing guidance on production of desalinated water for drinking-water. There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water. Of these; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources; may not be adequately addressed. Similar concerns have been noted about particular chemicals in source water or that are not well removed by the desalination process.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>and they deliver also; 435-7559; they are just east of Ric's Kountry Kitchen on Ras Abu Abboud (RAA). They are rather hard to see unless your are coming from the Corniche and you may have to jump the curb and park on the street side of the Mosque that is across from it. I highly recommend the Marhaba information guide (30 QR) it is a wealth of information and over 300 pages. http://www.explore-qatar.com/ also good There's a fine line between genius and insanity.

			<RelCText>Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ahh; I see. I've worked in oil camps before so I know what you mean about adjusting to the life.

Sometimes it's good to get into a different scene for a while. Is there taxi service outside Las Raffan?</RelCText>

This application may be one of several hundred rejected just because they have filled all available spaces in a particular program. Have the various certificates/degrees presented been attested? Many Western universities look very carefully at degrees/certificates from outside North America and even Europe because there are a significant number of forgeries (not saying that this is the case here).

			<RelCText>yes I've just checked that website and it's obviously not working...I got it from the Marhaba summer 07 edition; where you can find an article about homeschoolers in Qatar; in the education section. I thought if was a good starting point; since there seemst to be an organised group with membership for parents who teach curriucula full-time at home. On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

			<RelCText>We will be moving to Doha in the early spring. I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello guys;Im a filipino physiotherapist. parents should not be ashamed of having a child with special needs.If they dont do something about the condition of their child;they deprived the rights their child to have an education. In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future. This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl. Hope you like this film.</RelCText>

This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities &amp; are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians. Don't get dragged away by stupid man made rules when the creator has asked us to teach behaviour whatever way it applies.

			<RelQSubject>Why aren't people respecting Qatar?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I noticed many people do not respect local Qataries or they do not respect the country. They come here without having an idea about our culture and religion. All they think about is how much salary they will take. We as a Qataries feel worried about the thousands of outlandish people and we try to be open with others but if they respect our culture and our land. What do u think..?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"""The Star and Crescent signifies concentration; openness and victory; as well as sovereignty and divinity. According to tradition; in 339 BC a brilliant waxing moon save Byzantium (now Istanbul) from attack by Philip of Macedon. To mark their gratitude; the citizens adopted the Crescent of Diana as the city's emblem. When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary. In 1299; conquering what is now Turkey; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire. The star was added by Sultan Selim III in 1793 (its five points being established in 1844)."" Source : ""Signs &amp; Symbols; page 42; by Clare Gibson"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.</RelCText>

They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I too love to cook thai food; while living in AbuDhabi I brought a very good step by step cook book and it also tells you what you can use if you can't find what you need. The Mega Mart has almost eberything including the paste for tom soup;but they are closing on the 13th tomorrow. They will probably send all there stuff to the other one. Alot of fresh stuff can be found in large supermarkets. We love the yellow curry which I replace with shrimp.That receipe book has been a big help.Go to Thai Choice website for more receipes.

			<RelCText>Some of the stuff in Carrefour is aweful; but most of it is ok. Just cos it doesn't all look shiny and identical doesn't mean it's bad! I find the little corner shops usually have better stuff though; but obviously it costs more; otherwise try the fruit &amp; veg market off Salwa Road.

			<RelCText>LewisHamilton; Here is an honest report: Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations. The driving here is insane and extremely risky. The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world. Services here are generally very poor. You will witness all around you; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society. During the summer months (May to September) the heat is extreme; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay; stay indoors. During those months; life is all about work; home and shopping malls. No rain and sand storms instead. Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust (as thin as cement or talc powder) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health. You'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend (such as what you wear; what you say; what you drink and eat and when.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In private (hotel) beaches; both for men or women; there are no restrictions (just like elsewhere). In public beaches; for men there is no restrictions. For women; its not so much about the official restrictions; its more to do with the fact that many people (guys) are not prepared (educated) to behave in the presence of a women in a bikini.

Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl; in Qatara (a cultural village partially operating). The beaches are prepared to be public but they are subjected to a cover fee. All these beaches are artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris.

			<RelCText>honestly ... i dont think i have seen anyone skate boarding here... but i know there is a shop on salwa road (i think thats were its at) i used to do agressive skating and there are alot of good places here to do some good stuff... i think if you just be respectful to people and dont make a big scene about it ... then no one should care... besides... even if they do say anything whats the worst that could happen... if there is no sign around... the worse they can do is tell you to leave...Â  ____________________________________________________ just hanging out and watching dvd's with helen keller... kind of a quite night.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar is no longer a safe place to live in when compared to what it was before. Seeing is believing. The other day my wife was just waiting for me to take the car out from the parking area of our flat( she was standing inside the parking area but she was busy on her mobile ) when a guy in a Honda Civic stopped and asked her to hop in.

			<RelCText>Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someoneâs car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. Iâve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or somethingâ¦ï) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have been here for about 8 months; I know a bit about the place. There are a few good bars to go to to meet new people. Of course you want to meet women. I hear the Qube is a good place to meet girls. You could try your luck there. Where have you been?? I don't want to tell you places you have already been too.

			<RelCText>Ok; well there is Garveys; a british run pub. More casual. You can sit down talk and drink they usually have a band playing. There is also Palomas; however you need a female with you to get in. Aussie bar this is in Rydges hotel; same deal as palomas you need a woman with you. What sort of music you into? At the Diplomatic Club they get djs from all over the world. It is usually house music. They also have hip hop nights. Shit I think the Qube for males is about 80QRs; of course free for woman. Your right you know; we are treated with so much more respect here than in my home country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>mssahmed; you earn points by contributing; basically writing messages; answering to others. the point count show to others how involved you are and if you are a real identity (not a come and go once userid). This has the advantage of opening some doors to you; if you are willing to go through any. like 25 points is the minimum you need I happened to learn to be a member of the book club. otherwise I have not read (could have missed though) anything about getting a prize with your points. I wouldn't suggest it. Its the quality I want more than the quantity. dont you? ;) Burnout. Beware! :)</RelCText>

Itâs true the cost of an apartment in the Pearl is more than 1M.

			<RelCText>Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon. Qatar has a number of big names playing in the local league (usually end of career European and South American players who are lurred by the big bucks). The ATP Tennis Tour also visits Doha and entrance to matches are free!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>day you can hang with friends for the Christmas Dinner. You can decorate the house as we western people usually doing with Christmas tree; decoration around the house; Christmas flower; prepare a nice dinner (all the big hypermarket has nice special food for Christmas event.....even pork now in QDC).There are also many restaurants arranged a Christmas dinner with decoration; special food etc etc. We have spent 4 Christmas here and everytimes we got fun. Qatar is a boring place if you don't have friend or initiative but could be very interesting and full of fun if you are active person. Merry Christmas</RelCText>

We have out own transport (it is a 4x4; but we're not too adventurous when it comes to venturing off road!!) Along with suggestions; your reviews; prices and directions where you can would also be appreciated! We want to spend the week as tourists; rather than expats; so all advice appreciated.

Its enough I saw a couple of Scorpios on the road and I had to duck behind my steering wheel! Thank God it isnt so :) SAFARI is only good for India; gives the Indians a feel for BIG car.

			<RelCText>"TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket. There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800; which was enjoying the maximum market share. TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority. Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do. Safari is a Good Vehicle. But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road... They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled ""made in America"" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff.... Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA.... First see the vehicle and then Comment.... If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads (sorry not roads.. supposedly roads) It can drive in any country ;... trust me...."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yup; just got Titanium done last week after having a Pathfinder for two years. Makes a big difference and got it done for QR1700 and in 45 minutes. Very friendly and I went back the next day as thought I had bubbles in the windscreen. Hate to say it but they were right as disappeared after a week. Good luck; I got ours because of a newborn as well.

			<RelCText>I learned there are many types of Christian/Catholic in Qatar (Bible focus; Churches; International Church community; Baptism; etc). It is up to you. No one can force to change your religion; don't be afraid. We are all pray to the same God; the different are the way how we do it. There are no such force converting like you said. Religion is faith that comes from your heart; and what you feel in life. As long they teach good things which can make your life better; keep away from sin; it's fit for you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I believed that Christian Churches are limited in Qatar because a permission has to be approved and grant by the government just like I think what was happened in Catholic Church and other Christian Churches besides.

For the information only few sect of christians are recognized here on of which is catholic others ( who are not recognized) are not allowed to have a meeting or fellowship otherwise the police has the right to intervene.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The way I look at it is like this. My child is enrolled in a Western school. My child is not Muslim. Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better. The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Isobel said R.E ... In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives. What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I can't think of a good argument against learning the language of one's host nation (provided; as Isobel said; that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class). Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a ""comparative religion"" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to? I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on ""history of the Middle East and the Islamic World"" or ""Arab cultural studies"" (and much like an A....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The chicken or the egg causality dilemma arises from the expression ""which came first; the chicken or the egg?"" Chickens hatch from eggs; but eggs are laid by chickens; making it difficult to say which originally gave rise to the other. To ancient philosophers; the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began. 1 Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"In a manner of avoiding the question or joking; it can be said that ""the chicken"" came firstâin the structure of the question; simply because the words ""the chicken"" are said before the words ""the egg"" when the question is asked. In a question that is phrased differently; the answer would be different. Similarly; Randy Garner jokingly refers to an encyclopedic solution:[18] â These supporters call attention to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (2001). Upon careful examination of the entries and accompanying definitions; one can accurately assert that âchickenâ is found on page 232; while âeggâ is not found until page 398. Therefore; according to this argument; chicken clearly comes before egg. â"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if its parallel parking I can tell you what my driving instructor taught me: drive up parallel to the car in front of the spot you want to park in; about a foot away from it. reverse straight until you can see the boot of the other car through the back door window then turn the steering wheel and straighten it back up as you move. when the back; driver side corner of your car is in line with the car behind you; turn the wheel the other way and viola!! you slide right in.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>First prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you don't feel nervous. Make sure you don't knock over any pole. Begin Reverse 2 inches away from the pole in your right hand side. When you don't see the first corner of the pole of the parking box covers by the part of the car; take a full turn to the right. Adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line; then reverse slowly. When you see the white line in the middle of the left back wheel; take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking. I hope it helps!!!

			<RelCText>NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian.

			<RelCText>"Ok; I have a cat. But we take him to Pampered Pets whenever we travel. They also board dogs... The do a great job; and I know lots of people who take their animals there. If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name. (I'm ""Rackety's owner""-- they know him; not me!) The only catch is that they book up really far in advance. Call as far in advance as you can to book your space. Website: www.ppkdoha.com You can see photos of the place and get all the details there. They are way out of town; but will pick up your dog if you can't make it out there."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"dogs in Islam are acceptable so long as they serve a ""purpose"". In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are ""haram"" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to ""Arab cruelty"" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied ""I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions. All they ask is sufficient food; water; to be treated without pain or hurt; and a few kind words."""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The health certificate needs to be within one week but the vaccine has to be given at least 30 days before travel. It's not recommended to breed and sell puppies here - there are far too many irresponsible people who get bored and abandon them. Come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you'll see the number of pure-bred dogs that were abandoned because they got too big; or too energetic; or because their owner was going on vacation!</RelCText>

Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good?

			<RelCText>I would advise you to pick a different place. Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar. Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month. Plus they aren't going to pay you what you're worth because you are Chinese. Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here. Not fair; I know. If you do go...don't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom. I hope this helps. Sage</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Honestly; if you want to enrich your life then Qatar is the worst place I can think of; honestly. Qatar is the definition of an empty shell. Nothing of substance here whatsoever. Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only! There is no culture here. Work is the culture. As for the geography...the worst found anywhere in the world. No trees; no rivers; no lakes; no mountains; lots of traffic though; terrible climate; etc. etc. Combine that with no fun at all; unfair pay based on your nationality; and the surrender of your passport. If that is your idea of enriching your life... go for it!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Lots of jobs.... Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food &amp; other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans &amp; Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Science assumes that the universe started with a singularity; where there was nothing..nothing at all. Then logically; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows. I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity. Further; the 'anti-matter' and 'negetive energies' are still theoretical concepts. If the same are proven someday; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all. But; at present; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes; neutron stars or white dwarfs.</RelCText>

I'm sure whichever supernatural god fairy that created the world and the universe is going to absolutely demand that we all have really long hair or they'll be no afterlife for us.

			<RelQBody>Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required?

			<RelCText>You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year &amp; then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates &amp; work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license. Private clinics are very strict on accepting new nurse applicants. Your lucky to practice your profession with license here; but beware my friend...

			<RelCText>"Considering nationality; income etc is a smart thing to do IMHO. Nationality differences can lead to disputes about where you will live; if it is accepted to the family; if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more. As for financial status; love is great but it doesnt pay the bills. I for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p*ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life; but I guess thats just my female gold digging instinct. I love the fact that someone stated that we girls/ladies are the only ones who see their potential partner as an investment. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Copied verbatim from the Scotsman News website (http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1194252006): Superheroes unmasked as drink drivers KEVAN CHRISTIE POLICE who pulled over a suspected drink driver found he was dressed as Batman and had a drunken Superman sitting beside him. Batman; a provisional driving licence-holder; was found to be over the drink-drive limit. Superman; who held a full driving licence; was also breath-tested and found to be the same. Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over. A source at Fife Police said: ""This is a real fall from grace for two superheroes. I am sure drink driving is not allowed in Gotham City; and it is certainly not to allow....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"I think no one will sale a large amount for that; if you really need it; you should have taken a permit first from ministry of Health or elsewhere. Silica is if i am correct is derived from the element or a substance like acid or solventÂ and in that case; any large amount is questionable by authority; because; some might be used for making something destructive; ifÂ you know what i mean; or something use by sniffers??? I am not really sure of what i said; but; one thing is sure; if you need it in big quantity; you should have taken a permission from authority..Â Â  "" There's nothing we can do to change the past; if it teachesÂ  you a lesson profit from it then; forget it."""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So ""dog meat curry"" and ""dog puke"" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat ""dog meat"" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it ""field rats"" and ""snake meat""; if I am not wrong!"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you can't go wrong with either car; however; the Camry is bigger. You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car..

			<RelCText>Hi Alan; you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan. If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you. I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too. Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Mandilulur; ignore the profile; its nonsense. I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum. My name isn't Alan either; but it'll do for this forum :) B2D; driving is always fun; I love cars; always have. Plus its an adventure; never done it before :) Cy; I know about the rates; but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different; yes I pay more overall; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want. I'm a Brit; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear. I bought the car; I'll decide when to change. Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show; and they still aren't as good as a manual box. The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them; I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks. Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox; not a sodding computer. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good..

			<RelCText>My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In general the higher the price the newer and better the house/apartment. However note that some new houses have high rents ('cause they're new and big) but are located in crap areas! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR; and many of those places already have waiting lists. Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries. There's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates; it's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere. If your employer won't take care of it; best is to come here and take a look by yourself... Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Accommodations of higher rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in better quality than the cheaper ones. It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent. I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities. There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"our kids were there last year; but we have transferred them to a cheaper and better school. Can't say where as 'someone' will work out who i am. Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees?

			<RelCText>1. keep yourself busy with work. don't mind your others as long as your boss is happy with what you are doing. 2. less talk less mistake. never disclose any of your personal things. the more they know about you; the more they have something to talk about. 3. avoid having too much personal calls and chatting during office hours. they can also look after this. 4. if you want to join with their chats during break time; give them a good story on what happened to your former officemate whom you slammed after you knew she / he was backbiting you. scare them. Show them you are not tnat kind and better for them to be very careful with you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for starters; it is a good package and i believe you should take up the offer. You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios</RelCText>

			<RelCText>it depends upon the position; for ex; i know for a fact that a candidate was rejected becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly; he wasnt colour blind; there was a lot of defence for his case; but he was rejected because he couldnt recognise a shade of green. here it probably mattered becasue he would be working in the lab. so it really depends upon the field of activity.

			<RelCText>looks like you are refering to a lady engineer; if her work isnt field related; then theres a good possibility of her getting through; moreover if she is really good and the department encourages her case; a lot can happen. because in such cases; if the candidate is really deserving the HR may forward the case to the concerend department to reach a final decision.if the dept insists on having her and that her problem wont interfere with work; then anything is possible. all in its good time. happy heart DRIVE SAFE;someone is waiting for you at home</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Che and others; I'm also coming to Doha to work for Al Jazeera Insha Allah. Apart from waiting over 2 months now for my flight intinary since signing the contract (!) I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best</RelCText>

			<RelCText>aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hi; I strongly recommend Evian. It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called ""recommended milk intake is"" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Maybe your grandson still adjusting with the situation and the weather here. Because it happened also to my baby when we were travelling. She didn`t drink her milk like before; but after few days everything is back to normal. And for the water i recommend Nestle; or Masafi. Good luck</RelCText>
