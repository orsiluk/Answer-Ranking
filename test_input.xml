			<RelCText>well maybe if there wasn't 1 billion of you guys trying to take the same job from those few companies. Yet the new generation is also going crazy enrolling in IT degrees... How many IT jobs you think there are in this place? Unix and Linux are jobs for men in here.. Yes believe me; certain jobs are dedicated for each gender... an IT company that needs a Unix admin; that is 99.99% male dominated department would NEVER hire a woman.

			<RelCText>hi cooldood; for obtain new driving license which u never have your back home country license; u need to go to have eye test in khalifat police station. u need to pay some money ( i am not sure how much) I forget. sorry. i think is around 120QR. then u go to one of the driving school and registered your name and if this is your first they will asked you to take full course which is 40 days; or depending on your driving skill and experience. and waiting list for your turn to start the course may take some while. so good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Arrange International Driving Licence before leaving India. With the permission of Qatar Traffic Dept I think u can drive car till u r getting RP. After than u have to pass out the driving test ( 7 days min / 25 days &amp; 40 days full class cost around QR 2000 / )which is little tough here. In most of the driving school waiting list upto 2 months. Wish u all the best.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"...a horrible death in a mass of mangled metal. The law of averages is not on your side. The more you do it; the sooner you will end up on a slab. The fine is irrelevant. If you're still here to pay it then you should count yourself lucky. If you search ""road accidents in Qatar"" on youtube you will see a video of what happened when a Landcruiser jumped a signal and got obliterated by a truck doing 80kmh. Not pretty.

			<RelCText>Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>thanks to everyone (except 120kpm@roundabout) for your answers. this is my second trip to doha and normally i'm in dubai when in the middle east; where they are still serving alcohol in restaurants from 19.30. last time i was in doha quite a lot of people told me how doha is as liberal as dubai; because of the amount of expats there; so i did think that the hotels where tourists and business expats would be would make exceptions as they do in dubai. i have no problem not drinking; i am not much of a drinker anyway. just sometimes is nice to have a bottle of wine over dinner. 120kph; i don't appreciate being called an idiot. i wasn't asking for drugs or prostitutes or anything morally or legally wrong. i asked an innocent question about a city that i've only been to once before and your comment was uncalled for.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you mean if any one has adopted from QAWS recently. Then our experience was not so Good. We unfortunately adopted a kitten that had ringworms and had rash on her nose and other parts of the body. The new kitten gave all of the family ringworm rash leaving permanent marks on the body from this. We have had her treated and now she is fine. Where as we fully understand that QAWS is a fully voluntry organisation; but we feel that they could have advised us more about the health of the little kitten.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Ukeng; I think you were told that this kitten had been suffering from ringworm; in fact if I remember rightly you were asked to return at a later date when it had cleared up. If I remember we said ""as far as we can tell it has recovered"". Not being vets we have NEVER told an adopter that the animal they are adopting is 100% fully fit and healthy unless they have been to a vets. We have apologised for any inconvenience and even offered to take the kitten back into the shelter which you declined. It's just a shame that the one or two negative experiences people have seem to overwhelm the hundreds of animals we rescue and rehome successfully."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......</RelCText>

Are there reliable data on how the expatriate population will grow over the next five to ten years? Do you know whether there will be a growth in single people versus families; or vice versa.

			<RelCText>Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""what is the situation for residence permit?"" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me. Any approximate expectation on rental prices for ZigZag? What is the actual prices now for apartments in these towers since you already planning to sell them soon? Thanks."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"So you hold both. But it means that you don't need exit permits any more. Then if you quit your job you can stay move job do whatever. This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that ""boom"" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion. This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went; with only the person holding the flat at the c....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Aviduser; I would hope that the Zigzag towers are better than Beverley Hills Tower. I found the finishing to be awful. In some of the bathrooms you open the door 3cm and it hits the toilet bowl! I recently sold an apartment at The Pearl and made a million riyals profit. I bought it early on. The prices have gone up a lot. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It all depends on your lifestyle and what you are coming for. You can blow off 9000Qr in a week; a month; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month. You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car. For food and personal expenses; 2000-3000QR is what you need so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with ; and 4000QR to save! Email me if you need more info; use my profile to email me.

Anyway; i also work in an Oil &amp; Gas company as a Maintenance Planner; and am paid well. I would recommend you to join RasGas; where you get a Annual Ticket Fares (whether you go or not; you actually get around 4;000 more); get a Paid Annual Vacation (recieve your salary even when you are on Holidays for those Expenses); accomodation provided with free electricity and local phone call bills; and TOO much more benefits. For a Mechanical Engineer will be around QAR 26;000. And you also get to live in a world-class peaceful community; Also known as the Al Khor Community; with families of Qatargas' and Rasgas' Employees. All the benefits in RasGas are also provided in QatarGas; but RasGas has a bit more higher salary and you get monthly trips to Sealine beach resort for Quad-biking and Jet skiing; and also get PSP's; expensive mobile phones etc. Hope you get a good job and hope i've .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Firstly; I would like to thank all those who have responded to my question. I know salaries of individuals are private and confidential and it is not my intention to find out the salary of any particular individual. I merely like to know the typical salaries paid by Oil &amp; Gas companies for professionals with my level of experience because I am thinking of working in Doha. If anybody else can shed further light on this subject for me; it will be deeply appreciated.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>One of the major dilemma a prospective employee faces is his / her salary requirement. During the interview process; an applicant realise how good he / she was in answering questions being raised. An applicant should be able to impress HR that he is not only the best candidate but the only suitable candidate for the job. If you are able to impress HR then you can demand. How much you are worth? It all depends on YOU. Every company has a salary scale (minimum - maximum) for each and every job however; if you are worth more; demand. Chances are; you can get it; depending on YOU.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No you should not but it should normally come after the probationary period and should be requested by your manager. So rather than speaking to HR; may be you should ask your manager about it (if you are in contact with him/her).

			<RelCText>Depends on your position. 8;000 QR is quite less for an engineer. Most of Oil/Gas companies in Qatar gives up to 6 months probation periods; it depends upon your performance; maybe for only 3 months; you will get hired already as regular employee. After that; then you can bring your family in Qatar. For the other benefits; I have no idea; but probably its good because Rasgas is a big company. O.T.. When did you get the interview in Rasgas?

			<RelCText>VNINOH And everyone else - RASGAS Co. First up; congrats on the offer mate; a quick word; RASGAS is a very good company and standards of work and culture are pretty nice... Now coming to your question... The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic; cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice; Schooling is covered for your children; yearly air tickets for you and family; MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family; and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included... QR 15000K is a Bare minimum; by the way having said this; whats the position...but irrespective of that; QR 8000 is just a total waste; and DO NOT ACCEPT IT! I'm not being racist here; but for other Nationalities .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full. It's an industry practice.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first of all; I'm not a QA employee; just a QL junkie. It just happened that i have friends from QA and EY. why would they hide so many details from you? On the contract; you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor; you don't need to spend 10K for a flat. I don't get most of your point. Sorry. cheers; paul</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello Paul The problem is that if they can't find me an appartment I will end up paying it my own which will cost much more than 3500Qrs they're offred. Here comes my question: is it possible that they don't provide housing? Cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>And shame in doing evil; then we needn't/shouldn't have fear or shame in doing what's right and just. What we lack sometimes is the courage or maybe we fear the breaking of ties or loss of some worldly benefits. Or maybe we feel we will not be able to bear the pressure and commitment that may come once we take that path of speaking out against a wrong. The solution then is to first overcome these fears and know that by our keeping quiet not only will a wrong doer get off Scott free and a crime go unpunished; but we may very well find ourselves in the place of the victim next; with no one to speak for us!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Draccy; YES. And I am sure all will agree. Funny thing is; they will remain passive...saying ""What can we do"" ? That suggests they need a leader; a leader that tells them what to do. Seems there is no one around though. And things are left for others to deal with...others; who don't really have anything to do with the problem in the first place. others; who; due to circumstance; don;t know what kind of evil they are dealing with...hence; are losing one battle after the other.

			<RelCText>Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Nice beautiful; if a bit unkept; manmade Island which served quite rightly to provide enterteinment to the desperate families who coldn´t afford to pay or couldn´t get into an expensive healthclub. Once day; someone very clever decides to destroy it; leaving instead a piece of sand with one tree in the middle. Rumours have been circulating about the next project that will take its place: a fountain; an acuatic IKEA; a swim-thru McDonals; the tallest building ever made; etc...but so far; nothing has happened and most probably nothing will ever replace that little oasis of entertainment in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Two years ago; when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island; includes the entrance fee; i suppose)drow boat ride. There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees; watching the others swin; play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion). waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in... It was my small heaven; my recluse whenever I feel homesick; work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything... NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-( What you are is what you have been; and what you will be is what you do now. - Buddha</RelCText>

Been to nearly every corner of Qatar. And everything just sand and sand. Palm tree island one of my favourite place to take the kids. The beach there a bit rocky; but still better than nothing. There used to be a public beach next to Oasis; and now the build another hotel there (Sharq). Beach in Al Wakra not that good ... the only decent beach is inland sea which is quite long drive from Doha."</RelCText>

So what happened was that I was failing; and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep. But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping. In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students; so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade. Here is what happened in the exam. After one hour had passed in the exam; he told us if anyone of you wants to leave; he can leave and he will get a B. So I happily left. I was the only one to leave. For the rest who stayed he gave all of them A for believing in themselves.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i actually had a treatment at the six senses spa; and it was fantastic! i would definitely recommend it. but of course; it would depend on what you value more...the price or the value. what the spa in ritz offer is different from four seasons and chakra. from what i know; the spa in ritz is managed by six senses; and the outlook is traditional; but still luxurious. six senses's products are really good; and their service is also great. if you have time (and money); definitely try all of them...its best to find one that suits you</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted; the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy; unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides; the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player; brake system... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder. On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&amp;S; H&amp;M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment. Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good; so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there!!</RelCText>

So it is evident that they will not give me NOC and i will be banned for 2 yrs. My husband is working here in Qatar. But his salary is too low to apply for a family resident visa. I wish to know if I resign my job and once the company cancels my RP; can I come back to Qatar in family visit visa and extend it for another 5 months. So we hope by the time; we can make any arrangements for family resident visa. Please your reply is really valuable.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is no salary specification for visit visa; what matter most is NOC from your company and the profession on your RP must not be labour. Go to immigration or submit the following through your company PRO to immigration. NOC letter from your sponsor. Salary Pay Slip RP( The profession must not be labour) your wife and daughter passport Marriage certificate( attested by your embassy) You pay 200riya with this document.(you pay this with your card when you want submit) The visa will be one month visit visa but it can be extended to 6months with payment of 200riya every month provided your wife and child pass the medical test within the first month. Note- TO CHANGE YOUR FAMILY VISIT VISA TO FAMILY RESIDENCE VISA YOU MUST HAVE A SALARY OF 10;000 RIYA. best of luck.</RelCText>

Even though the water was too cold for swimming; the place is amazing.

			<RelCText>My husband is a stay at home dad too. I tried to get with QL to create a group for stay at home dads. Didnt happen. The same as the stay at home mom's; dad's seem some life outside of watching the kids or even just staying with the kids. PM me and I'll send you my hubby's #. I'm sure he'd be very happy to get together and chat. One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's; you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it. Welcome to Qatar and send me a message and I'll get you his contact --- email/phone; whatever</RelCText>

Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks for the info. What did they do in order to dignose you? And how long did it take? And do you know if you can get sleeping pills? Great that you are able to sleep all night. I have not done that since moving to Qatar. My sleeping patterns are up and down; more down :(</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected. Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru! Angelwings</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear Charlene; i have the same problem; for about 10 years. I saw a doctor here in Hamad Outpatients; his name is Abdoul Moneim; he is a very good psichiatrist; and he prescibed me the same sleeping pills i use to take in my country; that's Zolpidem (or Stillnox); its relly good; but he will not give you more than 14 tablets. When i canot get this medicine; i use to take Tryptozol 25 mg; but only half tablet; you can find it in any farmacy without prescription. I wish you good luck and sleep well..</RelCText>

I guess I should of just went and asked a Dr. here instead of assuming that it would be like it was in Kuwait and couldn't get anything stronger then a Advil! Hope you are getting good rest now... bajesus; I'm afraid Panaodol night would never do the trick for me. As for the luttuce juice; well; I would rather stay awake! lol. Thanks though! e46m3 I can relate for sure. Nothing worse then trying to sleep and then just laying there tossing and turning. I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop; lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least. I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day..... Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest! Thanks everyone; Charlene</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Have you made sure that you're cutting out all caffeine before sleeping? It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink. He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and e.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in. What I mean is: if for example you've worked in Oil &amp; Gas for years; but your last job (even just 6 momths) was in pharmaceuticals; then they will match you with pharmaceuticals! Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites. So; if you're looking for a job; I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky; but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan. 5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday. Now they say yes no problem; call back to confirm the details; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way. I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service. By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive. Most forums would not allow it. It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations; if not able to prove are simply slanderous.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with you Tinkerbell; they used to be polite and do what the customer wants and set the meter on entering the cab. Everything is the opposite now; no meters; they think you are foreign with loads of money. They chat too much in the car and ask questions which is none of their business. They decide where they want to go; NOT where you want to go; if it doesn't suit them; they shake their head and drive off!! If only there was another taxi company; then Karwa will start to pull up their socks!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the author of that article seemed to have no clue as to the country's appeal. First of all; he made it seem as the only arabic people interested in studying were Qataris and Egyptians (when 20% of the arab students here are from Kuwait; UAE and Saudi). He also tried to lightly mention a bit of disappointment about the fact that the 'mingling' period had no alcohol... (odd to mention it since I've never been to any educational event where there is alcohol in the UK or in Japan) He made it seem as nobody was interested in QU when the university is always full and it's a beautiful university at that. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips; Pics; Vids and m</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Tallg; When Booth killed Lincoln; he shouted "" Woe to the Traitors""; similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar. The Western media has an inherent bias; which is very subtle. Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces) Whereas; a Palestinian child  throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a ""Future terrorist"" I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower. However; I believe in calling a spade a spade. That's why a magazine like ""The Economist"" is respectable and a media source like ""Fox News"" or ""CNN"" is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners. The Internet; howvere; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation. :-) zaki the duckie"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Tallg; I have had remarks like 'what have you cooked'  or stick to poetry; which were completely irrelavant to the topic so don't be disappointed. It is a healthy article for many. I wanted to add few excerpts from Dr. Tidu Maini; who is a adviser to 'Sheikha Mouza'. He says 'developing countries will fail if they do not invest in education and research and convert their economies into knowledge based ones'. So there is a lot of interest being generated into research and knowledge; particularly in energy; environment and healthcare.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is land route via Saudi Arabia. You have to cross Qatar- Saudi border; then Saudi-UAE border. Both borders u will have to spend atleast one hour for clearance. Then you have to pay road insurance for both the countries(ie. Saudi and UAE). The road in between qatar- saudi border and saudi-UAE border is not that good. Extra care is required. UAE border post; you may have to scan your eye for entry visa purposes that can take sometime. Altogether you have to spend 6 to 7 hours..... enjoy your trip</RelCText>

What are the best things you can see or have in Abu dhabi?Lastly; is Qatari driving license valid over there? Are women allowed to drive or shop alone?

			<RelCText>According to other guys who answered its abudabi; but according to me its Qatar since i have experienced it. Bocz its a small country; most important..less traffic comparetively ; accomadation more or less similar to badi; can get drivers license easily(comparetively); every thing like airport hospitals hyper markets etc are easy to access. Further more it depends on your priorities;like what kind of guy you are; how your life style etc....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Both offers are very good; but looking at the cities and living conditions i would have preferred Abudhabi over Qatar reasons are. 1. Abudhabhi is in UAE which is very big compared to Qatar and u can move to Sharjah; Dubai; ajman; fujairah and manymore places without visa; entertainment and social life is good in Abudhabhi; 2. Living standards are good in Aubdhabhi; 3. Rentwise both cities offer you houses at same prices. 4. Traffic congesetion is more in Doha compared to Abudhabhi; So i would have preferred Abudhabhi</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So far anyone I've met that is with Al Jazeera international seems very content. They have generally good packages (or at least from what I hear) and comfortable accomodations. The staff is diverse with a large number of employees from the UK. I think it should be a good experience. But; really there are no 'suprises' ; but you will really have to come and experience it for yourself. You may love it and someone else may hate it and vise versa.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hello; My employer got me a business visa and not a working visa. They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket; but I failed to ask why.

			<RelCText>It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>this is a very normal thing.. once you got here your business visa should be converted to working visa. The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila;paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>luke_137; 1) You know why does this issue exist? There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers; and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny ; as an exception; it does not apply to you. Unlike others; you got your business visa legally; issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Hi Alex; You'll find the gay scene here a little odd. It's not acceptable and actually illegal to be gay here. If you are caught you will possibly be lashed and deported. That being said there are many MANY MANY gay men here. There is quite a thriving underground gay scene. No specific bars; but if you hang out at the Pearl; Admirals or Cloud Nyn; you defintely run into a few. Now; from what I understand there is a lot of ""boy-toy"" ""sugar-daddy"" action here. The Arab men aren't really comfortable with having a relationship; so they tend to stick to just sex. If you want lots of stuff like cars and apartments; there the guys you go too. If you want a relationship; unfortunatly; you might be out of luck. There are some really great gay guys here; and most of them want relationships; but they say it's just really hard to maintain one here (not surprising because heterosexual relationships are hard to maintain here too). It's just the lifestyle I guess. You're probably going to get a lot o....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; it depends on whay you do? driving and getting around is very unsafe in Doha. More so than Dubai i feel as in Dubai the police actually patrol a lot more on the road and act upon dangerous driving. In doha; they just ride around.

			<RelCText>yes it is true that it will be useless because even if you pass the prometric exam; you are not allowed to apply for a SCH medical license and dataflow verification because one of the requirement is to have a 2 years minimum experience. better to have that experience first in your home country then come back after you already have that experience.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Basically there is NO point in thinking of amount you will save; because with this salary you cant live a under average life even!; yes as others have said; you need to forget eating;travelling;calling your family back home;enjoying weekends and ofcourse stay in a room which is already occupied by atleast 5 people; then surely you can save upto 1000 Riyals. But this all is easier said and written than done!. So my friend dont think to accept the offer with this salary!

			<RelCText>Matt; I've been here pretty much since 2008; and overall the place has improved since then. Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located. Longer message than planned!! .....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>depend who you working for. I am sure every company have their own way doing things. For us ... we were given a company housing for the first 3 months ; then they give you allowance to look somewhere else. We receive our furniture allowance as soon as my husband pass his probation period. The first 2 weeks husband get a car and a driver to go to work; after that we rent a car till we received our resident permit and able to buy a car. Internet so far only 1 provider : Qtel.So take it or leave it... you dont have a choice. The pay tranferred to our local bank; then every few months we send the money to the UK. Anyway ... welcome to QL; do use the 'search' button on the top right to search any question you have in mind.

			<RelCText>Totally depends on your budget! Salwa Road (You can find some luxury designer brands and bathroom/kitchen fittings.) Home Center in City Center; Centerpoint/Al Asmakh Mall; and Musheireb. Homes R Us in Hyatt Plaza. Bo Concept in City Center. Souq Al Haraj in Najma area. ID Design in The Mall. Origins (www . originssofas . com) I usually end up buying from Home Center because it's relatively inexpensive; and at times I take things apart and customize them. Some of the couches in ID Design are very cute; colorful; modern and at a decent price if you are looking for something nicer than Home Center. But Doha still lacks a great basics store for furniture. That's why everyone is waiting on Ikea.</RelCText>

I&amp;#39;ve visited Najma Street; those furniture there looks knock-down or bargained furniture; or those that look bulky and old styled.....like the Sofa is full with artistic non-essential designs/ features. Besides HOME CENTRE; where else can I go to buy modern look; contemporary design furniture ??</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>That's the problem with furniture in Doha. Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices. We wanted a bed that cost 17;000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $1000; exact same bed. The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount; only for repeat customers! They wanted to maintain exclusivity. I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason. One of the two. Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Where can I buy curtains in Qatar?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My wife was recently quoted QR4k by a shop on Salwa Rd to do one (ONE!) window!As we've got about ten to do; I'd really rather not have that sort of outlay. I'd like to get 'proper' ones; with hooks at the top and a pulley on the side; but so far all we've seen is guys who want to prey on expats or that service Qataris; to whom money is no object.

			<RelCText>I will go and recommend King Koil. It's my father's place. Without sounding biased; you will ALWAYS get great deals and when my father says you get a guarantee; you get a guarantee 100% no questions asked. King Koil is one of the best mattresses around. Tell you what though; say that Khalifa Saleh recommended you (Saleh Haroon's son) and you might even get an extra discount! ^_^ As for Ikea; I have bought two mattresses from them in the past; I've had them go wonky or unshaped within 6 months and Ikea refused to even talk to me. __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net</RelCText>

Personally I would not bring furniture when it comes to a fully furnished apartment in Doha ; as they do have the basic stuff being put in already;such as tv; tv cabinet; wardrobe; sofa bed . Like me; I will be very soon moving to one of the fully furnished apartment as well; n now have the difficulties getting rid of my bed; sofa; tv n cabinets - omg it sure will gonna take some time y'know; so judging from my own experience; I would not recommend you to bring too many of your own furniture :) Oh and welcome to Doha! :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes there is and it tends to be cheaper if u choose this option; but then again it also means they might not provide too many furnitures to you. I think it varies too when it comes to different property companies providing just what sort of furnitures; so it's important to find out from each of them if you do wanna go for a semi furnished one :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>At this point you only have a temporary contract. You must past the medical exam which takes about a month to get your results. Meanwhile; you won't be issued a Qatar ID until you get your medical results and sign your permanent contract. Without a Qatar ID you won't be able to rent an apartment. Majority of the buildings have electrical and plumbing problems due to the unskilled foreign laborer's. Therefore; rent a fully furnished all-inclusive or company housing till you feel you might stay over a year.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree. Do not bring your furniture because most apartments around Doha are fully furnish.I notice the difference between fully &amp; semi is only 2k Qatari Riyals. I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I don't mind. So now i just mix my one set furniture which consist of 3 seater; 2 seater &amp; one seater;carpet &amp; one table with the apartment's furniture. Furniture at home centre are not that expensive IMO. if you do find a apartment or villa semi furnished.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ask any pathan (Pakistani nationals identified by their unique national dress) that you come across. Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup. If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop; but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying. One word of caution! Used furnitures are the primary source of blood sucker bed bugs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Most decent towers will have a pool as well as possibly a tennis court. Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs. The villa compound life is more suited towards families. Think suburbia vs. city life. It can easily take 45 minutes to get from Villagio to West Bay. Traffic is the #1 headache in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I haven't been but I think in Doha; where you are always being watched; this was a bad idea. How can you relax when you are under scrutiny? It's hardly a fun; carefree environment is it. My girl-friends that I have asked if they want to go said; simply; 'What; with all the perverts in Doha? No thanks'.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I dont really mind the dress code. I guess it will be hard for me not to stand out anyway. I do wish there was some kind of meduim when it comes to swim wear. Maybe there is. I guess I will have to find out. I'm sure there is something acceptable out there. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi there! don't expect too much.  your package includes basic; tranport allow HRA etc depending on what grade are you and 10% increment of basic salary every year depending on your boss' evaluations. Those allowances which you asked as far as I know are not  provided except OT during holidays no bonuses no incentives. You could only enjoy the unlimited ID90 SL booking hmmm  and very annoying in the airport. One confirmed annual ticket for your wife and yourself. Send me PM  I will give you more details.

			<RelCText>"just for everyone's info. the said annual ticket on each qatar airways staff is governed by their staff handbook. and it is always ""Subject to Load"" and not ""Confirmed"" so even you are on your annual leave you have to always wait at the staff check-in counter if there will be seats available. - live your life as simple as you are - money doesn't create man; but it is the man who created money - don't do what others say; just listen to them; but do what you feel good"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i think it will not be the same. there should be adifferent fee for each rating. if i'm not mistaken that's how it goes with most of the airlines. if you ask me; there's no need to bring your tools. most of the work are done by mechanics anyway :-)     goodluck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i agree with tallg and gypsy; even though you have a liqour permit you need to be discrete when transporting booze to your place; if you're a little bit observant there is a notice at QDC stating that transporting ligouqrs; specifically on those cartons; should be placed inside the trunk of their car; and should not be exposed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Above is correct QDC is the only alcohol store in Qatar and you will be about 10 mins max from it. The compound is great; its quiet loads of kids about if you have kids good for them. It also has a shop very handy. And i think they have started doing shisha and coffee in the clubhouse. Plus loads of nice people inc many of my collegues; your lucky to get it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>5 to 10 % more or less depends on where you are and what you getting... for example I give tips for the workers in petrol stations for each time I full the tank. I meant to say just give what you think its reasonable coz tips doesnt have a specific range.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Tipping taxi drivers</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>How much is deemed acceptable to tip a taxi driver? I was told by a couple of people who ave lived here for years that you dont tip them but i feel that as they are really helpful with assisting me and my kids in and out of the taxi; they deserve a tip. Also what do people do when a taxi driver doesnt turn on the meter on a very short trip and at the end of the trip; says pay as you wish? How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are: 1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from. I got my Confession Booth for those moments. 2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache. I Don't want memories of the local malls. 4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly. 5- and learn to difference between; drive Straight ahead; turn left and turn right. Then I might tip you... With a Thank you! The Red Pope of Qatar Living</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping; for there are some which is centralized. But if you're expecting to received 100 riyals tip per day; I can say there's a big possibilities that you might not get it; besides; for sure you're not just the only one who's working there as a waiter.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Welcome to doha; may your stay yield fruitfulness and prospects in your career. I believe your company men will arrive at the airport to pick you up. call Taxis are identified as ""KARWA"" in here. There's no regular practice in tipping for taxis in doha Qr.2+ will do; however if you dont prefer there's no harm. People who deserve tips 1. Runners(who serve you parcels while you are on car) for small restaurants. 2. Petrol fillers. 3. Private car cleaners 4. The lists are endless; you will identify once you arrive in here... 5. road side guys selling news papers on hot weather. best of luck."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thanks for your comments and advice. The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here is the thing; the shopkeepers are brainless idiots! Why? Take my local shop for example. There are no price tags on anything. You have to ask them 'how much is this'. I don't know the prices of anything in there. So when you go to pay; WHY tell you 11.50; with gum; just say 12 bloody riyals! How the hell am I going to know?!! That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money. They could do this without causing half the arguments. Do I want to pay more for my shopping? No. But I have never been into a shop and said '20 riyals? I am SURE my bill is 19.50'. They are so stupid.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank. They never neglect your emails when you complain; they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it; and they keep following up until you are satisfied. I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems. Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: ""take it or leave it...you don't have any other option"" My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS. They sell some cheap quality offers and they don't bother to even apologize; not to mention a compensation."</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>GPS Navigation</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Do any of you use a GPS to get around in Qatar? If so; does it help or hurt more? I was thinking of uploading the Garmin Middle East map but one person told me it's irrelevant since streets are re-routed there often. Just thought a navigator would make getting around a little easier when we first start driving but I don't want to blow $120 on something useless either.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit; all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability. Install it with GARMIN for mobile and complete the map of the area you need. Or just used google maps if you don't want get headache of renewal the maps. Im using GPS only to know where my position is and then figure out the fastest route because you know how often re-routing happened here in Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>HappyHorizon...Too lazy??? too tech savvy????? or just too much money??? :-) . No offence intended. Agree with Darude. Friday mornings are best to drive around in Doha. Most people do not get out of their homes until after lunch. The best way is to just drive around in squares. U will eventually reach your starting point. And yes; road works never end in Doha.

			<RelCText>I cant understand why people buy electronics in Qatar. I get all my stuff off of Amazon and have it shipped by Aramex. It costs me about 25% less even with the cost of shipping. Whatever you buy in Doha will be overpriced and out of date. The only advantage would be you have a local one year warranty; but those are rarely honoured anyways.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Online transactions are safe if you know your way around a pc. If your in doubt - use a pre paid credit card. I use aramex as well. The service is not all that great. They received two items from amazon on the same date and shipped one a week after the other. But amazon customer service is very good. You don't need to go their office to set up the account. You can register online from their website for a ship and shop account as well. Only reason why I would buy something from here over amazon/aramex is when I feel the local warranty is required or if I need it immediately.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>They can't do it on the spot bec they have other things to fix or attend which was first on the line. you have to leave it and comeback after a few days. As ive said; Amoud; its probably under service warranty of 1 or 2 years not so sure with 2 years. so it will be free for now.

Good thing about Nokia is; that even if you dont have the receipt they register the serial number and have it on the system so your warranty is still valid even if you lost the receipt. ___________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If your mobile is under warranty..you can have it repair or if its beyond repair.. then they will replace the earpiece..like what happened before to my Nokia mobile.. I cant open it.. what they did.. they replace the face of the phone for which the on &amp; off switch is connected( they change it cz it can't be repair)... Like Amoud..I suggest you go to Al Nasser Branch which is just opposite or adjacent of Doha Clinic.. say 100 meters opposite DC..you can look for Merla.. she can help you with your problem...hope this would be of help to your problem...</RelCText>

I have heard that they don't like to employ Indians but I don't know for sure. They move extremely slowly whenever I have any dealings with them. Don't respond to emails; never answer a direct question; and don't return calls. They don't permit staff to access Internet resources regardless of need for job. I would imagine the work is secure because they are definitiely not a popular employer. Getting ""looked after"" is relative. You will be better looked after than someone in a labor camp; not as well looked after as someone feeding from the SIDRA trough."</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>American Woman in search of answers</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>HELP. I am currently dating a man who lives in Qatar for work and is from the UK. Lately he has been talking about me moving over there.  What do I need to know? Can a single man and women live together?  Any other important things I should be considering? I am 31; I like to go out for drinks and have a good time. Is this going to be an issue?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"Well; for one thing; you don't just move to Qatar. You have to have a residence visa; which means you have to be sponsored; usually by a family member or an employer. They're not going to let your BF sponsor you. Can you live together? If you don't mind living illegally; sure; you can live together. Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors; but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. You can drink; lots of people do (I do); but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law. You would be well advised to be very discreet. Lastly; Qatar would not be my first choice if having ""a good time"" were all that important to me. I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can. It's not all that bad a place to live; but you do have to be somewhat resourceful."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>unless you really really really and I mean really like the guy! Come for a short visit and see it for yourself; check the place out. And as k977etc pointed out you'll need to find a sponsor; (i.e. employer) to be able to move here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe; which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria; Lebanon and Jordan. Though I personally don't drink; the vast majority of people I know do; and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!) Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here? If you are thinking about getting married to the guy; I believe he can sponsor you; contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol). Their number is (974) 4884101. Good luck! Don't let one man's dream become another's nightmare</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Yes; you can live together - You'll need to be discreet; i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it. Yes; you can go out for drinks - No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period. Also; never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable. But; I agree fully with ""OOO"". Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I dont think there is any problem with the issues you have raised. I have a few western friends who have been living together for quite a while now. Although they met each other after coming here and were on seperate sponsorships but ended up living together. As far as drinking is concerned. I do not drink myself (except water; juice &amp; milk :); people say that they have absolutely no problem accessing alcohol. Hope this helps.</RelCText>

On Zionist settlers who were provided with Palestinean homes by their armies after having ripped off these homes from the original Palestineans? I think these invaders/settlers should go back to the countries they came from. ""There are women and children on both sides"" Yes! On 1 side there are the women &amp; children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth; and on the other side there are the women &amp; children who left their countries around the world; came to invade a country which don't belong to them; started killing the families of the original owners; and stole their homes. Now you can use your brain to judge! ""I am not a supporter of any violence"" ummmmm........me too! But if violence came to my home; then I'd have no other option!

			<RelCText>I do not support in any way the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis and the tragic loss of life of innocents is unforgiveable. What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.  </RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Is it that hard ?</RelQSubject>

			<RelCText>Hey ! Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Crazy88; Thanks for your reply; you were right on why I didn't mentioned the job position I am applying for; but I was just saying in General; I mean I wasn't asking for a job more than asking about any company that hiring now and why is it difficult to find a high professionalism organization. about the recruiting agencies; I did many search and got many recruitment agencies; but thought if someone could provide with a good one.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ahmad; Firstly; QL forums is like a social network where we can open a discussion or get to know each other. SO ( I am not writing email to my boss ) Secondly; You were supposed to reply by giving suggestions or ideas not to look after my spelling just to tell me that you are a professional person. if you really want show it then reply in the return subject not spelling. go get your 30;000 Ryal before talking about the professionalism buddy :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You don't have to be defensive. I pointed out a defect that you can work on to get better chances. It is not about social network Vs Email to your boss. You can get a slight chance for a job offer through qatarliving. Would you rather hire someone that can't write correct English if you can hire someone that can? Also; why would you even mention what I have on another thread? You don't even know the full story? Again you contradict the true meaning of professionalism. My other thread is due to people who take money and give you a fake receipt and do not deliver. How is this my fault? Good luck to you; based on my poor judgement; you might need a lot of it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you are welcome; shapil; it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT; since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP; I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit). I hope this time you see the difference. If not; just drop it..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if you get over 7k you can sponser him with fam visa. once he is here and under your visa; He should bring a police clearance report from his home country (need to be attested by his Embassy here) so let him find a job; he will need to give the police clearance report and the company will fix him a work visa. (not the same as yours) he will still remain under your sponsorship. or different option if his job is well paid and he will get good benefits like tickets and also housing allowance he can ask his new employer to be his sponsor</RelCText>

			<RelCText>bringing him on family visit visa (6 months) and sponsoring him for the Residence permit are two different things. Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>we have the same issue. for the past few months our bills wouldn't go up to 300QR even; but now when we checked our bill we were suprised that we need to pay 804QR! there was no reading for the water consumption but they put around 200QR as 'extra charges'. when my husband inquired about this he was told that they have increased their rate due to their 'new system' and that they will just refund whatever amount they'll owe us next month.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Salleh...salary is relative to what you do for a living. Having said that you can be the best judge of how good or bad your offer is once you've done some research. DO a search in QL. Plenty of threads bout cost of living in Doha. 1. 2 br apartment 8500-12000 pm 2. Groceries for two 2500 pm 3. Water + electricity 500 pm 4. Telephone+internet+cable 500-100 pm 5. Car rental 2000 pm for the likes of Corolla/civic 6. School fees....sorry no idea 7. Other....no idea..depends what your definition is Hope this helps. Good lucK!!!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If they can't house you then you dont take it. Or at least get it in the contract that they will pay your Housing Rent Bill as the rents increase 25% every year. If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) &amp; sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar. If your wife is here &amp; she is not working it could be damn boring for her.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hi Salleh; after reading the above definition of leaving in qatar u might have gone craze dont feel so; what i feel is 1 Rent : if you search you will get 2 BHK at 5000-6000K 2.Food expenses for two : 1500-2000K 3.Car : 1000-1500 K (if u are buying a car) plan of staying more than 3years; 4.School : 500-600K per month; 5.Other misc. expenses : depends on you; In my opinion 10000K per month should do; think over and deicde</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one; such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc. I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums); then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose. Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted! OK - am going to.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Don't worry Scarlett; you are not the first and will not be the last. It seem to happen in the Qatar Living forum more then any of the others. Jauntie is right. I found QL by googling Qatar schools and I found this sight. If all I had found was bickering and guys trying to pick up women - I don't think I would have come back to it. It has been a big help. I have read so many of the threads and come back all the time to read more - informative and very entertaining. I hope to get there soon so I can join the Social Group. There are some very interesting people here that I would love to meet in person. I love meeting people from different places; cultures; etc. We have been expats on and off for many; many years. Nice to see another ""Southern Bell"" on the sight. I am not in Doha yet. My husband is there and I will get there eventually. Take care and enjoy your time in Doha. Lisa"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Um_Nooh and aquabong; With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks; I would consider them all; way above most of the people who exercise a ""management"" position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society. For your information; from where I come from; a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee; is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing! My reply to Um_Nooh; came out that way because of the way she posted her question! Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise. Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job; or whatever. My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to high....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect; it had nothing to do; and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers; and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background). If you want to talk about answering; and stating things appropriately; you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well; who if I may add is NOT qatari; shows a lot about your approach. Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari; I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers; or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me; and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens; you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them! The only person that acted wrongly is you.....</RelCText>

You have to pay your penalty only for 5 month not for 8 which is 5x30=150. 150x10 = 1500. either if you go to basmsahba or whatever they call it they will charge u the same amount and air tickets.and they will give the date .

			<RelCText>Lol; anyone can wear an Abaya. But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray?

			<RelCText>Yes it's alright for men to wear short sleeve shirts.Like you said the more conservative;the better and that rule applies to men as well.As this is a conservative muslim country;total respect for local customs and traditions need to be observed.Women aren't advised to wear sleeve less shirts or tops as well as shorts.Business dress code is the same as anywhere else.For men formal suiting and for women nothing specific bit it has be decent so as not to offend anyone and more importantaly;to avoid any sort of unwanted attention.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just for woman you can wear short sleeves and not above the knee length skirt or pants but the most important thing is your blouse should not reveal your .... when trying to pick up your grocery(as i've seen myself how the male cashier and other customers where staring at the woman with every procduct she tried to get from her trolly to the cashier)or if you have kids you have to follow or kneel for them ;so just something that will focus on your beauty in your face and anywhere else in the body;and good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with MR M;its not much to worry of your dress..its not an issue over here ;just be modest;even walking short (knee length)for ladies same with male is acceptable;but avoid showing to much affection with your husband while in public to avoid getting the attention of others.</RelCText>

Have paid around 1130 for a quarter course...with 12 on road lessons and 6 theory /classroom/simulator classes..After taking 3 or 4 classes; pay another 50 QAR for registering for the test. Complete all your theory and on road sessions; and then take ur test. In case ;you( hope you do not) fail in first attempt; you can re-take the test by paying another 250 QAR. Failure on second attempt would entail you to regist for a fresh ( qtr;half or full )course all over again.Pay a small tip to ur driver and he might teach you some special lessons on clearing the driving test. All the best and hope you don't turn out to be just another brash driver speeding like a maniac on the roads here in Qatar Cheers</RelCText>

The time for training; preparation for exams and postponement of exams date and all is really frustrating but like someone earlier said confidence during road test; slow driving and observation and following basic rules will do you alot.

			<RelCText>Things to do before you begin drifting... . . . 1. Set up a cone in the middle of the lot. Drive up on the cone and rip the handbrake in an attempt to do a 180. Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone. Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this... “We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.” Sir Winston Churchill</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that Israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them...got him really wound up and scared. So I explained to him that the other kids were Muslim; and they they believed certain things that we didn't necessarily believe in. They don't they don't eat pork; we do; we believe in Santa; they don't; etc. I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it's never nice; but it happens. And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can; but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident. It's sad but it happens. And then I explained that some of our best family friends are Jewish and/or Israelis; and I asked if he knew that (no; he didn't); and then I said that I didn't think that our friends were bad people at all (he agreed); and so I didn't think it was fa.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>but I do like the way Umm handled it. I have a friend; she is from England her husband from Lebanon. Her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in NO WAY was he going to have anything to do with Lebanon because his friends did not like Arabs. This boys goes to one of the 'supposed' best schools in Doha. I told my friend; that if that was my kid; they would have gone to school with a Cedar strapped to their hand; some Lebanese food and Union Jack underpants. My thoughts are my own; but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Though I didnt pay anything to my teacher during my brief 4 days lessons....but normally they very less paid....(my teacher's salary was QR-700/-). So its always good to pay them some...after all they teach you the tricks of passing the test. Looting for around 500-700 Riyals is a bit too much. Normally people give them around QR-200 in equal installments of QR 50/- during their lessons.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Intercontinental Tent i think is the best... Very nice food; good sheesha and the entertainment is also good... Marriott wasnt that good; the food was nice but the sheesha was terrible as was the entertainment; small hall; no AC and very empty. Ritz Carlton.. Didnt go this year but last year it was amazing... Great Moroccan food; nice entertainment with dancers and live singers and the spinning egyptian man... great sheesha... I also heard that Diplomatic club is the best in Do7a but good luck trying to get a table; ive tried for soooo long and its always fully booked.. :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why buy? Do it yourself. 4 ripe bananas 6 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp self raising flour (or 2 tbsp plain flour + 1 level tsp baking powder) 1 tbsp rice flour 2 tbsp chopped cashewnuts 1/2 cup milk Except for the chopped cashewnuts; put all other ingredients in a liquidiser and blend to get a pan cake like consistancy. If the batter is too thick add a little more milk. If it is too thin add a little more flour. Pass the batter through a strainer to remove all lumps. Lastly add the chopped cashewnuts and mix. Keep batter aside for half an hour. Heat a non stick frying pan and add a little butter. Pour spoon fulls of batter in the pan to make small pancakes. Serve warm or cold with honey or ice cream.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>NEW DELHI — The remote; destitute state of Orissa; marred for years by Hindu-versus-Christian violence; erupted in a retaliatory killing on Monday after the murder of a Hindu leader led a mob to burn small Christian churches; prayer halls and an orphanage that had housed 21 children. The police said a woman’s body; charred beyond recognition; was found inside the church orphanage. The church’s pastor; whom the police did not identify and who was injured in the fire; told the authorities that the body was that of a nun working there. No children were injured. The attack on the orphanage on Monday; in an isolated district called Bargarh; came after the killing Saturday of a Hindu leader who had been associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad; or World Hindu Council; and who was leading a drive to wean local villagers from Christianity. Radical Hindu groups like the council are vehemently opposed to conversions to Christianity; which in India tend to focus on traditionally downtrodde.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>BHUBANESHWAR; India: Protesters set fire to several houses in eastern India on Monday in an area where recent clashes between Hindus and Christians have left at least 11 people dead; police said. No one was injured in the latest attack in Orissa state; but police feared the arson will increase tension in a region with a history of violence along religious lines. Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians; but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali; a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week. The violence began late last month with the killing of a Hindu leader; which police blamed on Maoist rebels but Hindu activists blamed on Christian militants. In apparent retaliation; Hindu hard-liners set fire to a Christian orphanage; killing a Christian woman and seriously injuring a priest. Th.....</RelCText>

Thomas December 17; 2008 BANGALORE; India (UCAN) -- Namrata Nayak’s face combines the trauma and the hope of the whole Christian community in Orissa state; eastern India. Methodist Bishop Sampath Kumar observed; ""Her burn scars have disappeared and there is a smile on her face; hope in her eyes. ”The prelate; who until he retired was presiding bishop of the Methodist Church’s Bangalore Episcopal Area; told UCA News the 10-year-old girl’s lively presence impressed him greatly. ""She did not complain about anything; nor did she show any vengeance toward anyone;” Bishop Kumar said. Instead; she came across as a “happy innocent child who wants to live for Jesus.” With another child and 24 widows; Namrata traveled 1;400 kilometers to Bangalore in southern India to attend an advance Christmas celebration for women widowed during the recent anti-Christian violence in Orissa.

Which is a very difficult task concerning the fact that every race; region has its own outlook on terror and wouldn't prefer others pointing at them. Look at what happened to war against terror witnessed in Iraq; Afghanistan etc. This is a big disaster and look at all the innocent blood stains; will they ever be wiped off? Whatever is done so far to remove terror is caused its evil head to reappear in another form. First the Muslim terrorist kills the Christians the Christians plot a way to tackle it calling it war against terror and creates terror in Muslims and the rest of the world; Muslims Terrorists killing the mostly tolerant Hindus causes Hindus to become Terrorists and this blame game continues. So the best way to tackle terror at present is to leave it to the world leaders. They will screw everything up for s.....</RelCText>

Don't you think it's also young men in their land cruisers also belting along roads at break neck speeds? and some people of both genders just racing into roundabouts without even bloody looking? Why just this morning on my way into work; a qatari gentleman in a really nice car basically barged into me and we would have had quite a bad crash if i hadn't been polite enough to just stop and let him in rather than have most of my car side taken off by him. I think it's more a case of many problems on the roads of qatar taht really need to be taken care of!

			<RelCText>Supermarkets - We look for Indian supermarkets to buy Indian spices and vegetables which are not available in other shops. Doctors - Most of the Indians look for Indian doctors because of either language and communication problems or they are not treated well (attitude). Even I have noticed Arabs prefer to go to Arabic speaking doctors so that they can communicate thier illness better. Restaurants - We prefer all different types of restaurants. However; we avoid going back to restaurants where we are not treated well. Regarding other communities; they have no choice as there are not many supermarkets and doctors from their country.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"rsher - Was looking in the latest Marhaba (welcome) book and saw that both Starfish and Creative Child take kids beginning at age 1 but if you get here at 10 months it might take 2 months or so on a waiting list anyway. Also; saw Mary Poppins Nursery. Haven't heard anything about this one except one mom was unimpressed when she saw a t.v. in one of the rooms. It's a little bit further down the road from Starfish. Emails - starfishkids@hotmail.com creativechildqatar@yahoo.com marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two ""r""s) Also; is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so; give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures. Sort of a moving here guide."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hello; I got a very similar offer and I rejected some months ago. Now; with a disaster global economy I would like to came back and have this opportunity again. With this offer I guess you could save 1.500 $ x month if your life style is not too expensive. Moreover; I was well impressed about quality of life in Doha (I love sea and sailing). The reason why I rejected was that I had to move very quick and I was scared of such a big change in my life and no time for fixing some business in my hometown. My suggestion is to accept and enjoy!

			<RelCText>Dear fellow; That's relative...Compare the offer with what you gettin now; I mean your current income. Similar to anywhere worldwide ; you can live on US$ 1000$ / month or your expensenses may reach as much as ten times (10;000 $)a month. In qatar; a family can decently live with 8000-10;000 QR /month + MIDDLE CLASS accomadation 8;000 QR + SCHOOLING 2000 qr a month . That makes around 20;000 QR in total. you may back-calculate any anticipated savings. As to the car; credit business help getting whatever car you may dream and that cost 2000-3000 QR /month for you to own a 2009 Model -luxuary car . Don't forget annual vacation; family airtickets and medical insurance costs.... Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Abu Dhabi is the best choice. This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution. I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities. Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round. I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>my first trainset was also TOMY; that was 10years ago; which i handed over to my son which for now; only pieces of plastic tracks remains. i've got my first german model last year which is a starter set. i think its better that both you and your husband will be doing this hobby. What I am doing is that; i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations; bridges; etc..). We're still waiting for the accessories that we need to construct our first diorama set (1200x600mm). try to go to miniatur wunderland website to check the largest modeltrain assembled.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you go from Khalifa Stadium towards corniche; reach the firestation roundabout; take a right. You will get Athel;tes village on the right. Keep going straight and you pass a roundabout. Immediately after is an underpass. Dont go to the underpass; but take the road on the right of the underpass. You reach another roundabout. take a u-turn and come back and take the second right turn. You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre. Now about the price; It is the cheapest in the middle east. It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it). On Fridays and other weekends; you may have to book in advance. Its a lovely place with 32 international quality lanes. they have cafeteria and free internet access via wi-fi. Its a rockin place; though not many people know about it. For bookings etc; contact: Ph: 4353054; 4329132; 4329140 or 4329178. Their e-mail address is qatarbowlingcenter@gmail.com Whew; hope the info was useful. And like Mi.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Soniya this is ridiculous rule . It is not the same in UAE or Oman or Bahrain or not even in KSA where i stayed alone for a couple of years . In Doha ; last summer -when my family was out of Qatar ; i was at office on friday and wanted to go to carrefour to buy something-villagio security blocked me . Ridiculous ; i m a serious buyer and needed to buy things . Then their head of security asked on cam -is the guy asian or british or european ; the nepali security guy replied asian sir ;immediately he said No ; block him . Stupid Rule .</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Fridays 10AM - 8PM no entry for bachelors in the malls. I have stayed in Saudi; and ofcourse they do not have such rules coz they are closed on any given day (except after 8pm or so). They too have family days; and even in the parks only families are allowed. Next; i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday. Irrespective of what time i went. This rule is to keep those perverts away who have nothing better to do but stare at women during their free time!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Braids is not such a big problem. Once I spoke to a kenyan lady who works for Qatar Airways; and she said there are lots of girls who do it (not in a barber's shop; but at home). Finding out who can do braids is easy; just ask (or better let your wife ask) someone with nicely done braids; who did it for them The problem is that my wife wants to stop using braids and do hair relaxation; treatment etc. In other words a professional.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Extra charges against personal loan with CBQ</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My husband availed a personal loan from Commercial Bank of Qatar but just now we have accessed his bank accounts through their website and we are really shocked to find out that aside from the monthly payment (which we have believed interest of 10.99% per annum has been included; they are also adding up some amount on monthly basis as well.

			<RelCText>Clearly you should be careful of the words that you use in a forum; because they can be easily taken out of context. By saying Islam in Qatar is a farce; are you attacking Islam; the Muslims; the people; the institutions...? The non-Muslim banks; and hotels that allow 2 of the biggest societal problems to occur have the blessing of the government... so whose problem is it; Islam's or the state's? And; although many think lightly of the 2 problems of Interest and Alcohol; society in Qatar ALL benefit from the laws that prevent alcohol consumption and their effects in public (if you doubt it; go to any UK city centre on Friday night). And those who think interest is not a problem; look at America and the foreclosure situation.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank you all for your insights and hope that my query will not create any conflict; argument or whatsoever to anyone of you. As my husband &amp; I were formerly working in Abu Dhabi; UAE and had also experiences availing loans from 2 banks. One from his side on a fixed interest rate &amp; on my side; on a floating interest rate (which I believe is just the same as variable interest rate). Both of which; we had no question about or might probably; from where I got my loan; they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Saving money... good advice always!! Luckily Doha is a bit more about an adventure for both of us actually. We realized as comfortable as we were in the States; we were playing it a bit safe with Life. It's not that money isnt nice (it is) but the numbers are letting us pursue a bit of housing fun at the same time. Since my offer wont let me convert housing to a per diem I either spend it or lose it. Sooooo we're shopping around for the lifestyles of the not so rich but certainly shameless ;) Thanks Mandi; will check out West Bay Lagoon. Cristiani is already pressing me for the Pearl and since I'll be at the Airport; betting I'm in for a 30-45 minute commute already....

			<RelCText>since you are working at the airport; check the villas at Al Fardan 1. It would only be a short commute. It it on D-ring road across from LuLu Hypermarket. I have been here for 5 years and seen a lot of different compounds. Al Fardan 1 has the most beautiful pool area and the villas are HUGE! They even have 5 bedroom villas with private pools in the backyard. By the way; it can take almost an hour to go from West Bay Lagoon to the airport in morning traffic. I know from experience.

			<RelCText>QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay. The pay level depends upon the needs of the job; not on your qualifications. $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position. $16;000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha; so I would think that is probably a good salary; but again it depends on the job. The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As a result many brands sometimes appear like they've been removed completely until they get around to restocking them.....which takes WAY too long for some reason.

			<RelCText>Anjas; i said Carrefour...  Ragnarock; i know what u mean; but it is just weird that all the products from this brand were suddenly not available... so i don't think it was the issue of stocking up. and as Fembot said; they won't say why those products are no longer available.

			<RelCText>But like I said with other brands (though maybe with not as WIDE a range of products) they have gone missing for a LONG time then suddenly showed up....so we are forced to do the stockpiling thing when they ARE available LOL...sad; but this is how its done here if you want to ensure you don't run out of the brands you like. The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically. And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it; you should be able to find them in other stores (unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason). Hope that helps. Stay safe.

			<RelCText>When it comes to Identical LapTops; Then Carrefour is cheaper; yet that does not mean that Carrefour provides the best choices.[Note: what you buy from them has warrenty]. If you are looking for acertain brand with special specificatins; you might not find it at carrefour... So what you pay for is what you get according to what you want whether in Jarrir ; Carrefour or any other place. We can say one thing: they both are the most popular and saffest to buy from. :-)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Another one of these questions written most probably by a Qatarbeautyshop employee/owner with the answer being reference to Qatarbeautyshop in the first 3 posts... It is not difficult to find small and extra small sizes in Qatar. As for Qatarbeautyshop; i'd personally would not buy clothes online unless i've tried them out - and i'm a guy. Women are more picky. Moreover shopping in malls/window shopping is one big pastime in Qatar - sorry but your business may not be that feasible in Qatar. Nevertheless wish you all the best however please stop these posts - it is very cheap and does not look good for your business.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey San Diego; so pleased to find W fellows:) Indeed more places to go are on the way! W is supposed to be a very cool and New York style place - especially the living room concept. The word is that they are opening in May 2008. How come you know so much about hotels in DOha? You happen to read a lot or you work for the industry?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The W website says January; but word on the street is early spring. Looking at how fast La Cigale is opening; it more then likely won't be till late spring. It's the first of something like 14 starwood hotels that will be opening in the next couple of years. W is a boutique hotel; which means that all the furniture and stuff is for sale. Cool eh. :) Just google W for more information; I promise you won't just get a bunch of Bush sites.

			<RelCText>"Well Shangri-La and Renaissance haven't even begun construction to my knowledge. The Grand Hyatt is well underway by the Ritz; it's supposed to resembel the Sharq Village and Spa. Word on the Street is that La Cigale came here with the promise that they would be allowed to serve pork by opening and now the powers that be are going back on their word; which is causing problems.

			<RelCText>"You must also remember what was originally on the site of the Mall in the old arport area. That massive and squalid shanty town. The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place. There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by ""The Caravan"". The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios; on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect. If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find; Globe China was the place to go."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There was no life without the Malls earlier; but i should say people used to spend more time at home getting together with friends or family... Like every said it was only center and then the mall in the late nineties ... But things have changed a lot since city center and the other malls have opened up ....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....</RelCText>
