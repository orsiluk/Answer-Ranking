			<RelCText>For family with 2 child; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary. Further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance. Additionally any medical requirements. Now its upto you to decide...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Aamirjaved's calculation is somewhat on the high side. I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000. For the schooling; if you are an Asian; it is not that costly to my understanding. As such; my view is that if you are an Asian; grab the offer; but if you are a westerner; kick it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We can't say if it's a good deal - you don't include details of the role. Try to get schooling included in the package. Agree with aamirjaved. Depends on what standard of living you want. Depending on area; you may need 10k+ for a nice 2 bed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Because there are not too much specialty stores that caters only professional cameras (DSLRs). Mostly camera stores can be found only in malls but they are not specialty stores. You know how mall owners jack-up prices of goods; especially if it comes or imported outside Doha. If you have friends in UAE; you can ask them to buy you one and just shipped it you. Or; there are some people selling DLSRs here in QL. You can search the classified ad here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>well the salary seem to be good; but if you are bring your family then house of 2BK without furnish and good lcoation would not cost you less then 4000 qr. then furnuiture and basic requirement that shall shoot upto 10K. So indirect 5k per month would be the rent. then car if you go for high end car apprx starting from 100000 to 123000 then monthy EMI would be between 4000 to 4500. then food and other expensies..Now it is totallly depend on how you spend it dude.

			<RelCText>It depends on your living standard and expectation for savings.

Can the prsent employer of the wife play havoc ? ..Can he stop her doing so ?....

			<RelCText>correct... just follow what darude's suggest... 1> get married. 2> once handed the marriage documents; let your wife to ask from his current Sponsor to change sponsorship to HUSBAND SPONSORSHIP; u may do that instantly or upon expiry of you wife's visa. your wife can still continue with her current job without leaving the country. 3>ask for Mandoub services to do the job; it is only a simple paperwork to change sponsorship. 4>if your wife wishes to quit the job; she may do so... so many reasons to tell the previous sponsor for quiting the job like she is pregnant... after giving birth reasons like she needs to care for you infant. ~~~ There is no substitute for victory yet there is risks of too much oversight... ~~~</RelCText>

			<RelCText>But make sure you have her papers sorted out at the labour office; meaning her sponsor; being yourself or your own sponsor; signs the official relase papers.

			<RelCText>Dr. fawaz on al waab street I absolutely would not recommend if you start getting problems after 9:30 pm; you will be referred to HMC; and if you are not registerred their it will take more time; best is to stick to HMC. Actually any clinic is not suitable; they are unable to provide the care you need when complications start; you will need tyo go to an hospital.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Good OB/GYN?? Low back problems??</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Can anyone recommend a good OB/GYN to follow up on pregnancy? Or maybe recommend a hospital or centre that has good doctors and proper equipment. Another health related issue: has anyone had any success in treating low back pain here in Doha? If one needs to have a CT scan or an MRI; where should one go? And what about chiropractic centres; are they any good? Thanks!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>"Hi ditto; Sorry to estate the obvious and if I sound a little patronasing; but couldn't your back pain be related to the fact that you are pregnant??? If so I think is best if you leave it untreated; I used to have a lot of pain in my back too and it dissapeared after giving birth. It is normal; it doesn't mean that there is something ""wrong"" with your back. Anyways; there are lots of doctors here. The Hammad women hospital is very good and have modern equipment; I was treated there.. I also heard very good things about Al Emadi and the Doha Clinic. I did try the American Hospital and didn't like it at all. Women Hospital: 439 6666 Al Emadi: 466 6009 Doha Clinic: 432 7300 Doha Chripractic Centre: 4650012 HOpe that helps."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Actually i wasn't really very clear in my message cuz i didn't think it was necessary to give a lot of details; but now that u ask; the fact is i am not pregnant yet but i want to have another baby. However; I've had back problems since my first pregnancy which was over 2 years ago; so my problem is do i try to fix my back first or go ahead and get pregnant which will probably cause more back problems then afterwards start treating my back. Thanks for the phone numbers; i already have these; i was hoping to get names of doctors people actually tried; cuz my experience here hasn't been so great. Thanks &amp; i appreciate your reply Butterfly.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>hello ditto; i do think you need to see a chiropractor; and if you do have back pain of course it means there is something wrong with your back. SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight. Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic; its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect;reduce;and help pervent nervous system dysfunction.</RelCText>

Do remember that all units of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system; you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn. It can take half and hour to almost an hour and half to see the doctor.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>..considering that while in Qatar;you might have to get a No Objection certificate from your present employer in Qatar to move over to any better offer. A villa might sound to be big; but; how many are to share the villa ? And who is paying for your air travel ? Shared accomodation = shared food + shared communication expenses + shared expense over sightseeing or going out. Hmmph...While everyone is entitled to his/her own views; my view is that your package is a tad low and you have to really think through to save something. Cheers</RelCText>

			<RelCText>How can it be old news??? The two reports (yours and mine) are from the same day; year; month.... They are only a few hours apart. Just shows that Georgia needs to stop listening to what they are being told. They say they are taking control and the U.S. says a few hours later they aren't. Yeaaa they also thought the US and nato would bail them out. They aren't just making up this stuff as they go along.

			<RelCText>You ask: By the way what is the actual position of Qtel towards illegal downloading Common cense tells me: If QTEL has not blocked those web sites; I'm not saying Is right or wrong; I keep my neutrality on that issue. Then keep on doing what ever you are doing with torrents. Know by posting the topic in public forum and QL uses the portal of Qtel; then you are risking the possibilities for them blocking them.

			<RelCText>"vpn or proxy services provide a dedicated encrypted private link to a server somewhere else in the world. Then you connect via the vpn server to the internet. they charge a monthly fee and there are many to choose from. Some give options of which country to connect to.

			<RelCText>"DW; not sure if it will affect your speed or not. Depends on too many things along the ""pipe"" it guess. It could help the ports issue; but as I said earlier I have no issue with UTorrent on the normal DSL so have not moved to fibre yet. It definitely helps with the ""waving finger"" on blocked websites. You can try one of the VPNs for a month - I think prices are around $10 - I used www.overplay.net a while ago. It was easy to pay with paypal (and then stop the subscription via paypal)"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Less or more; piracy is everywhere. Don't say that only Indians are doing this. The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet; certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries. So; don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good; no matter where is it.

			<RelCText>"King is right. Utorrent (www.utorrent.com) is the best and simplest torrent client. Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download (i.e just type the name of the movie). It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS. This will sort it so the movie or program with the highest number of seeders will show first. This guarantees you a higher speed as ""higher number of seeders = greater speed"". Hope this helps. Other good sites are: demonoid.com torrentz.com torrent.to but the one i use for movies is: www.torrentfive.com"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>And of course; it depends on your ADSL speed provided by Qtel. The Fastest ADSL speed for home use available is 2 Mbps; which means you can download up to 256 KB per second as a maximum when your line is idle. Check my page here; I made a small table listing the three different ADSL speeds provided by Qtel for home use. http://ilovesarah.us (scroll to bottom to see table)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>agree to pal... if u want faster; legal ownership of movies; u buy it. but ofcourse there's some for promotional; personal and education use... it's all up to you on how you treat those movies u download. also; it depends on wat type of movies; mostly new and current ones are basically illegal; but for those old but goodies are somehow permitted to share online. for those type of movies; i suggests two things: first; for online viewing... there are youtube; veoh; google videos; megavideo; joox; supernovatube; imeem etc. that u could check and watch some movies second; u could download it (as this is what you ask for right?) using different methods; some like; you could use website assistance like keepvid; clipnabber; file2hd; splandoo; downloadflv; mediapirate; feelingtea; video downloader; and many more to check from. just copy and paste the link of video you required to those website and press ok or get or whatever it mentioned there then the original link of the movie will be shown......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>MFX is right; axxo movies are the best and ... Pal; the arguments about the torrents never end ... They say that the guy who uploaded the movie obtained a legal copy and purchase that and then he is free to do whatever with it; copy it or destroy it or throw it in the garbage ... So if there is someone to be questioned then it should be the one who upload it; not the people downloading the movies. One more thing; 140 Q.R for an original DVD ??? Don't you think that it is really so so overpriced?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>londonalgier; First; you need to install a bittorrent client (try http://download.utorrent.com/1.7.7/utorrent.exe) then use a torrent Search site like www.isohunt.com. Download the torrent then sit and relax. To know more about bittorent concept check wipidia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol) Hope this is helpful.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've been there a few times already; but always in a group of at least 4 cars. I can tell you that some of my friends keep their cars on 2WD mode most of the times. But I consider these guys very experienced as they only needed to use the 4WD mode when getting someone out of trouble. My old boss even had to drive back (in an Isuzu Trooper; mind you) from deep within the inland sea only on 2WD because the gear-box malfunctioned. So; I stand with TB that it can be done but will not risk it myself.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You have to follow the Manual from the Car Manufacturer. That is why they made the car and they have studied for a decade. If you have or you own the Car you can make and experiment of your own; buddy... Let say every 3000 Kms of running you have to change oil; or there is some sound you have notice then you have to visit to the service centers for checkup.

And this poor girl started talking about some South Africans; Asian countries.. . it just shows that she even couldn't get a QUESTION! And also I think; she had some certain answers ready; and she just tried to apply one of them to this question; which was absolutely not applicable. You can hear what she is saying: ""I think US should help such places as South Africans; Asian countries with education so that they will be able to build our future for us"".. or something like that… Shortly; no sense whatsoever.. but don't forget she is a teenager; and just got lost in front of all this huge audience.."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Big question why she ran away? Best thing to do is seek the help of the POLO office. But i'm wishing you luck if you get good treatment as my husband had witnessed how they treat ran away maid. Their reason for acting such is that some of the maids they tried to help would end up going back to their employer. So all the efforts that the embassy had done been put to waste.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It all depends on the contractual obligations;however; being a maid; she too deserves rest; a holiday; if not for 3 days atleast for 2 days and on mutual understanding she can come for 2 hours atleast depending on the needs. Besides all; the flexibility between both is more useful tool here; take care......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>chevroletaveo .. her coming back is not the problem; if OP's maid ever gets caught doing something wrong in Qatar then OP will be questioned as her sponsors.

			<RelCText>"Here's the content of the thread; You are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in Qatar - the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be ""appropriately dressed"" - no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees (even at night in nightclubs etc) and no shoulders. I've heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and (in the case of a 14 year old) showing their knees. I've been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc (Landmark in particular). One friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into W last weekend - each of them had something ""inappropriate"" from cleavage; to knees to shoulders. You also have to now show either your ID card or passport for entry into bars and (the scary part) if you aren't dressed appropriately they take your ID card and scan it and send ....."</RelCText>

Also; they should have started implementing these rules a decade ago. They've let things go to far to have a hope in hell of policing it properly.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I do consider Qatar home and I like it; but that is because I have family and friends here and I try not to let certain things get me down. My boyfriend lives in Bahrain however and I visit him there every weekend. Bahrain is a lot more laid back; you can buy pork; get a glass of wine and a restaurant and access anything you want on the internet. It doesn't have all the oil money so the locals are a little more down to earth but it's more developed. Better restaurants and shopping malls. Most of all; you can get a penthouse apartment for 6000QAR.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>what do you think about genesis' comments? are there really that many saudis that go to bahrain on the weekends? how do they (the women) treat the western women (the saudis; and the more conservative bahrainis. my wife; who dresses western conservative; always coverering her shoulders and legs down to her ankles; often gets dirty looks from many of the women here who are completely covered in black head-to-toe. her sister even got pushed around a little by a couple of them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully. Yes lot's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends; but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis. The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend. Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I haven't noticed a difference. As for dress; I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here. There are more single women as well so I don't feel like I stand out so much. Bahrani girls don't wear the abaya as much as here and I haven't seen to many in hijab. I doubt she'll notice many stares at all. As for it becoming more conservative; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that's where all the prosititutes hang out. But my guess is you won't even notice they are gone.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i use the htc diamond; i have had it for almost 6 months; if you are the kind who uses mobile for emails and internet alot;then this is not an option.. the wireless signal is never stable and keeps disconnecting; the phone freezes too much; especially after receiving a phone call. i reset my phone almost everyday since using it. The graphics are cool;i think they have the best compared to other phones; the resolution is another thing;its not as bright as the other phones;it would have made the graphics more cooler if it was more brighter...AND....the camera! if u r one who enjoys taking pics with mobile...this is not the one for you....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i personally hate the blackberry; it is a pain in the arse to use. The iphone i pretty over rated in my opinion; yeah it's a tidy piece of kit got some cool things; but it is stupidly expensive here; IF i ever get one i will wait till Vodaphone release them (and they will). got to agree with shyampsunder on this one; go with HTC; they have being doing the touch systems for alot of brands of phone for a long time; and now they have their own phone; their features are great; and they are very easy to use. Wish i had one. I use a n95 been using it for over a year now; and it does everything i need it to. ____________________________</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dont listen to their nonsense. If you want to marry a Qatari girl; you will first of all need her families approval. After that - you may apply for an approval from higher authorities. The husband isn't; under any circumstance; going to get the Qatari passport if this is accepted and approved. The children will hold the father nationality - and they will not benefit any of the privileges that locals have. Good luck and let me know if you need more information.</RelCText>

I was offered a job and submitted all the required docs; after waiting for a month i was told by HR that the request was refused first time round and has been reapplied for. HR says it is currently ""under process"" Anyone know if its likely to be approved and any possible reasons for it taking so long?"</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Am not sure about exchanging the licence but for the test first of all there is no parallel parking test You can go to RAYA driving school and go the police officer first with the form and all required documents and try to exchange your license if not he will sign the form for you to do the test directly. You should do this first because the school will till that you need to take 10 lessons course You will start at 5:30 with the theoretical (signs exam) they will ask not more than 5-6 signs if you answered with confidence and quickly. THE DRIVING SCHOOL HAVE A SMALL BOOKLET that has around 30 signs Then they will let you know if you pass if yes you go out to start the practical exam: 1) Is the hill test ; you have to stop in the middle (on the line painted in the street) then continue till the end of it; then reverse back to you starting point ; which means you have to reverse as L shape 2) Then you go to the parking test; you have to do it in one shot and make sure not to cross the li.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Simply becoz i work for them... hee haw!!! No really; if you're going to DC; then you're better off taking the QR flight coz we fly there non-stop and the aircraft is the A340-600 which is a beauty to fly in; especially if you're flying the premium class... even if it is economy; the pitch in between the seats is so much better than EK. If you're flying to NY; then i think EK go there direct; coz we fly to Newark (EWR) viz Geneva; on the A330; which is also a good aircraft to fly in... Hell yeh; all QR aircrafts are good to fly in you know why... ""Coz we take you more personally""... (and i'm saying that with a straight face)..."</RelCText>

Their staff in Doha were so crappy that they didn't know what to answer me. All they had to say was DXB is a very busy station and such things tend to happen. I was like yeah fine; but is that what you will keep saying to rest of 9 families standing here with me!!?? LOL Contrastingly; and I am being very true here; I haven't faced a single problem with Qatar Airways flights for as long as I could remember. Last I can remember having a problem on QR was perhaps with food or something 3 years back.

			<RelCText>Hell yeh... i have seriously to ask the sales dept. for my cut on the promotions im doing on their behalf... hey sorry if you guys are jinxed with QR; but really the crew services etc is much better than EK; coz I know for a fact that the EK crew dun give a damn bout service; they will be like yeh will get you that when i'm here next and you're like waiting. Regd you Jakarta trip; i think we fly the A300 aircraft there and those aircraft's are being converted into freighters; coz they are kinda old. LHR-DOH...cancelled... why? I'm sure there was a reason for that and you would have been compensated (not that it is any consolation) And AMM trip... well delays were a part of the airport expansion during that time... So dun you think i deserve a good BONUS this year... (if they have heard of anything like that)...lol!!!

			<RelCText>Yeh I flew Joberg from Dubai like 2 years ago when we were starting there and i was upgraded to Businesss Class. But i can really tell you that QR Economy class service on these long haul flights was better than the EK J class service. Besides; they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1.5 hours; so if your connecting anytime less than that; youu can rest assured; your baggage won't ride the flight you're in. So not the case with QR.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The only plausible reason would be that those 4 guys were not QR staff but the Ground Handling staff and hence they must have been pointing to the QR staff. Kinda happens in most places; the handling company will always refer you to the airline...

Even the crew friends of mine laugh about it cos they can't really commit to what time their arrival back in Doha would be at; to catch up on a party / a movie or something. ----------------------------------------- 1200 QL Points!!!

			<RelCText>Apple I am not arguing with you. My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you; your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You got good points; and neither i'm not arguing w/ you. I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police; you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly; the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff &amp; the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan; Credit cards; Personal loans); then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly; only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is; if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases; nothing wrong to clear your name &amp; follow up at the place where the charges agains.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>go to the sales center in the arrivals terminal &amp; talk to the sales staff there. almaha only takes bookings prior to 24 hours of the flights; how ever depending on the work load they have a chance of accepting your booking; yet you might have to pay a sum of Qr 300.00 extra to the normal service fee. i too agree with Khanan. she will be able to proceed her self if you are able of instructing her on how to. make sure you give her clear instructions. if she is a bit old; ask her to hire a porter for just Qr 20.00(porter counter is located to the left once you enter the baggage area. it will give you a porter ticket enabling her to hire a porter) which; the porter will locate the bag for her &amp; bring her to you. if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice. i dont see any point of u wasting about 500-600qr when you can get the work done just in 20qr - 30qr. all the best &amp; wish your mom a pleasant stay in DOH!</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Any park to visit at Night?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi all; I am wondering if there are any parks in Doha (preferably near Al Sadd area) with good night-time lighting; swings for kids; BBQ grills (optional) and track for walking / jogging. I want to take my family for regular strolls at night. For those who have been to Abu Dhabi; I am looking for a park similar to the one opposite to Sheikh Zayed Mosque there. Thanks in anticipation for your help.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I think there is no park here that allows you to BBQ. . . not sure though but i havent seen any :( Corniche have these mini playground for kids. Katara is nice for sightseeing. You can BBQ at the beach but its a bit far from AlSadd though. Aspire park have a running path/track where you can jog. Now; to answer your question; i havent seen any park here where you can do all that; especially the BBQ thing :(</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well; I remember this happening around my place last year &amp; my dad had to literally go out and shout at them. U can just get the supervisor's contact number from those workers and speak to him regarding this. They are actually not permitted to work in residential areas at odd hours (23.00hrs - 5.00hrs). Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities. Good Luck!!!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree honestpedal ; especially since in most of the posts plato seems to have a lot of issues with Islam beliefs; conflicting with his beliefs. Yes i know its for your love; but hey; it must be tough.

			<RelCText>The reason behind most non-muslims who have converted was only to marry a Muslim girl. They know that they cannot have her any other way; unless she sins; and not all do. Yes she should accept the man for who he is and for what he believes in; but us as Muslim females - we are restricted to standards and we cannot change them. Its too complicated to discuss; but good luck. Take more time to learn Islam and maybe the faith in Allah will grow in your heart - not for HER (the girl-friend) but for Allah himself.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have lived my life for a full (over 25 years) and I have met too many who have converted for being with a women. I did not point fingers at anyone - so I don't think you should be sensitive about anything that I say. In Arabic we say; ilKhair yikhis - ou ilShar yi'2im; which means ((the good is of one; the bad is generalized)). I hope that is understood. Good luck and Allah yahdi man yasha2!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Great photoshop Edifis and appropriate theme. LOL Dating sites all seem to be controlled by the same holding group; just the web addresses are different; the page layout; photographs etc are the same. Just by the accessing person's IP address they change the country in the advertisement; so as to attract a click. It all ends up the same ""Pay by Creditcard/Paypal/Money Transfer"".

Than asked if they (the U.S.) should cross the border to Pakistan. She replied to him that's exactly what they should do; in the debate between Obama and McCain; that was Obama's position while McCain was against it.

			<RelCText>Its not a matter of equal rights between man or woman. In Islam man candivroce and women has also (but mostly twisted cultural crap take over the islamic values); but to safegaurd the process there is some time period for reconcialiation between the couple.

			<RelCText>do not use kerosene or oil heaters in your home. carbon monoxide is the number one winter killer. Also if you use any space heater keep all drapes and linens a minimum of 3 feet away on all sides. never plug a space heater into a power strip; only directly into the wll to prevent high current draw from melting insulation and starting a fire; These things are dangerous even with proper precautions so at least read the warnings and heed them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Good info tyler the first thing that came to mind for me was to plug the heater directly into the wall because the extension cords/plugs cannot handle the power and will burn out or cause a fire!!

			<RelCText>I do not know what styles are available; however the stand alone ones that look like old radiators are sealed steam heaters and you can also buy the small electric heaters in which you can physically see the coils and they blow air via a fan across the coils. Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with. If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up. Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat. A 3 dog night is darn cold but on that same evening a one woman night may cause perspiration.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Just buy a new replacement plug and repair the existing cord. Next step is to make sure the outlet is installed properly and then verify the rating on the breaker. Don't trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination. Not the best electrical work is being done in the new construction; always verify.

			<RelCText>Ice Maiden; That's so similar to my story. Its been a year for me as a stay home mommy and this will be same for next 6 months and then we will leave Qatar so that I can continue working. I stayed home for all this time here just so that we could stay together as a family while hubby completes his assignments here. Have questioned my decision myself quite a lot of time but I am happy and so is my family. So that's all that matters in the end :-) Sorry for the little hijack.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>a decent Nursery over here that keeps your kid until 3pm. It is not like England over here. Avoid in house food too. Too many 'support staff' from third world countries that don't wash their hands. Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor' staff they had. Look at is this way; if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery; you would expect the staff to be trained. Over here we don't have that. Most of them have 'degrees' from a Mickey Mouse University. They say they have degrees in Nursing; Education and Admin. Most can't speak English. Really do your research; it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then don't even know what they are supposed to be talking about. They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one. They don't care at all that your kid’s education may be hindered by them lying. Just be careful.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you want anything close to a garden you will have to most likely get on an older compound or a stand-alone. You can still get nice villas on older compounds but they don't seem to be building large gardens with new compounds...very tight.

			<RelCText>Well thanks for all your replies - you are a helpful lot I can see this forum is going to be a lifeline to me! I am most concerned about garden rather than location and I think judging by what I have found out so far location is very important on how much villas cost. My husband has been out for a trip already and says that there are really no horrible places to live in Doha at al! An older or stand alone villa sounds like the bext chance of having a garden attached. I will have a look at all the recommended websites this evening - many thanks again for all your replies</RelCText>

			<RelCText>30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor! Most cleaners here are either Philipino's; Sri Lankans or Indonesians. I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough. Speaking English reasonably well also helps! Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk? Unless you also want someone for child minding. My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job. She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices! LOL We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory! Ours pick up and deliver too. Good luck in your search and hope this helps!</RelCText>

My house is a 4 bedroom; 4 bathrooms. I know we have overpaid him for years but was alright with doing so. However; with that being said how no idea how much one charges per hour.

			<RelCText>just commenting how exspensive the accomodation in Doha at the moment. 4 yrs ago when we just arrived; beverly hills was 6500 QR; and we thought that was exspensive. Safwany ... i guess u know how much Beverly Hills cost now. My son school is in DESS; so i guess when i move i need to move somewhere around that area. At the moment i am commuting in the traffic daily from Muntaza traffic light to the school. Got alot of girlfriend who looking around for a house. Everytime they call for the agent they will asked where your hubby working for? Bachtel; Maersk; Halliburton or something like that. Then they know how much your allowance would be. If your hubby working in small company; they dont bother to respond to your query. Rant over ...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Novita77; I don't know exactly how much it is the beverly hills but I think it wont be less than 13;000. Some agents are worse than the greedy landlords; it is better not to tell them where their hubbys work so they can get a response; or you can tell them to contact me if you want :) By the way; I may have something very nice in this area but it is not cheap; what is your budget ?

			<RelCText>You can get an apartment for around 6;000 Riyals (2-bedroom) in a reasonably good area; a car can be hired for 1;800 to 2;000 Riyals a month (or buy one as you won't have a problem to get finance for buying) and the rest is up to you; how much you spend on food. You can go to 5 star restaurants and pay 300 Riyals for a meal or go to the shwarma shops and other more simple restaurants and pay less than 30 Riyals. There is choice for every taste/price/possibilities. I would never consider Saudi - I wouldn't want to live in 'jail'.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This is an attractive package. Depends really on how you are going to live here: Villa living is between 10 -14 000QR/month for something nice; and apartment living is between 6500 -8500QR/month for a 2-3 bedroom.

Watch out.. Don't do that.. Keep on mind you are responsible for the liquor purshased in QDC. Pay attention to strangers outside QDC.. Cheers"</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I remember my Eid childhood. It was great. We'd first meet up at my grandfather's home. We'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding. We'd all go from house to house; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal. After going door to door; we'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast. Parents would usually chat. Families get together. People visit and they have some tea and snacks. We pray.

			<RelCText>Oh Oryx; you are so right! Ramadan should be a month of less (material things) and more (spirituality). For a lot it is. Our schedules do not change much (eg. we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion). We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal. Then we have dinner in the evening. We get up before dawn for a small breakfast. We try to be better Muslims in this month...in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year. I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan. This is something to do with us; of course; and also the influx of expats. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>We tend to do a bit of baking prior to Eid. Usually the night before (or earlier if you're really organised) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets. These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours. They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid. What I've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home. I guess it's because we don't have family here; so our friends tend to become our new support structure. On the 2 Eids that I've so far spent in Qatar our 'new' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items!

She: Have you ever cheated on me? He: NO! Why you even asking? She: Will you kiss me? He: Yes! She: Will you hit me? He: No way! I'm not such kind of person! She: Can I trust you? He: Yes.

			<RelCText>My husband just went to the QDC yesterday but the bill seems to have vanished. Anyway; the cost is reasonable. The beer usually comes in cases of 24 and there is a good selection.

They limit the amount you can spend to 10% of your salary.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here are the list which i found here in QL i just made copy and paste ^_^ LOL: Bars in Doha (Starting from Rugby Club moving to Marriott)including drink prices; average nationality of customer; musical tastes and % of prostitutes. Rugby Club: Similar to Garveys only maybe 60% British; not as many rig pigs and a lot more 16 year olds. Sometimes a DJ plays. Never seen any pros there either. Nearly impossible to get into now if you don’t have a membership. Average drink price: 15QR Ramada: Orion: Located on the top of the new Ramada Plaza; it's 80% male; mostly Indian/Arab. I've never noticed the music but I think there's a Filipino band some nights. Average drink price: 30 QR Manhatten: Tiny little bar also located in Ramada Plaza. 99% Qatari men. Average drink price: 40 QR Bubbles: 50% men/50% women usually in couples with a good line of Qatari's holding up the bar. Serves champagne/cocktails and has a singer and piano player that play too loudly. Average drink price: 50QR Sherazad: T.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Drink with the locals? This is an Islamic country; the locals don't drink. There are no longer any bars except the Rugby Club that are not attached to Hotels as far as I know. You have to show your ID card to get into lisenced premises here so not sure how it will work with a visitor visa. It is definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drunk in public. Sorry if I sound unwelcoming; I really don't mean to; just not sure if you are going to be disapointed that this isn't what you expect.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>available beer types?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am thinking of coming to Doha soon to live. OK I understand about alcohol permits and how there is just one shop (must be very busy with a few hundred thousand expats!). As someone who enjoys more flavorsome beers than standard lager I wondered what brands are available? i.e. Are there any English ales? Belgian beers (other than Stella)? Interesting German beers? Or is it just Bud; Heineken etc.?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Tsardoz - Talking about flavoursome beers; you can buy Franziskaner wheat beer here. Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation. So if you're a SH fan like me; drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles). You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters. As a true blue Aussie; I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick. VB; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold. If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it; try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"My husband brought home some Carlton a few weeks ago and I'm almost positive it said ""Cold"" on it. Maybe they just got it in? It's not a beer I'm used to so I didn't really pay much attention to it."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'm pretty dejected so far ... oh well I'll get over it. Kingfisher Strong; Franziskaner (thanks Pothole!) and Old Speckled Hen sound about the most interesting for my tastes. Any German or Czech lagers? EDIT: Hmmm; reviews for Kingfisher Strong aren't wild ... http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/91/1896 I'll make up my own mind though!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My parents started giving us beer when we were about 14. We had whiskey when were about the same age; but for a teenager it isn't really that nice. In summer it was gin and tonics; and wine too. We didn't have vodka in the house; but it's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks. In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks; chips; chocolate; sweet snacks; candy and burgers on a daily basis. Obesity and its related illnesses pose a much bigger threat to public health than alcohol abuse.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days... Yep counting calories and exercise works; but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation; so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies...

			<RelCText>Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast; cer.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....</RelCText>

Go to BHS.. in Landmark.. very nice styles and large sizes... go to splash.. as FS they have a wide range of sizes and styles.. H&amp;M in Villagio... also has variety..

			<RelCText>Thanks aaid. I plan to go to Salam one evening so I'll let you know what I find if I go before you. From reading up online I'm veering towards the IXUS 860 because of its wide angle lens. 8mp is more than enough for my needs so I don't think it's worth paying the extra for the 12mp 960 which doesn't have the wide angle lens (they seem to be the only differences) thatguy - Thanks. I do plan to buy online but I wanted to try out the various models before I ordered. Carrefour only have a couple of Canon compact cameras; none of them IXUS (and they appeared to have stop stocking Canon SLRs and lenses for some reason); and the Kodak shops have a very poor selection of manufacturers. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It is really complicated..Palestine is probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world is being lead by politics and power. To your point; I would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the Zionist regime which pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among UN member states. Additionally; west is a bit tired of supporting the Zionist's states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability..The west was a key player in creating the Zionist state but they did not have the same intention Zionist's had..My thought anyway..interesting topic :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Why nearly all countries agreed was quite simple. Most believe in a homeland for the Palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be. So making Palestine an observe state is a statement of intent without backing a full independence. Israel while continuing to build settlements in the West Bank is undermining the whole process and it seems obvious they want to swallow all Palestinian terrority. Shame on them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>and rationality. Yes it should have been done much earlier; however what has happened has happened; and it's best to look at it from a better now than later; and better late than never angle.

			<RelCText>I think the world is becoming rather weary of this; apparently; irresolvable problem. This latest move is mostly symbolic; but very important and the environment of the region has changed; post Arab Spring. The global community wants a peaceful resolution and this should be two States; according to the 1967 agreement. Lets be clear; Israel is not full of Zionists (but they still seem to hold the power) and the Palestinians need to address the problem of Hamas for this to move forwards. I am optimistic about the move....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for some crying is not abt weakness or wanting the other person to say sorry or give in to the situation but instead for me when i do cry/shed my tears is because i am so angry/upset that i want to say things that i am sure is gonna hurt the other person (saying out of anger) but i am trying so hard to control it as once it comes out there is no way of taking it back so to speak. so i am controlling it so hard that instead tears come flowing down; most ppl in an angry state will say things (hurtful things) in the moment of anger and when all has subsided realize that and its too late as it is already said and done with and hence hurts the other person........ my mom once told me the tooth paste story- only take the amt that you need if you were to squeeze too much of out the tube ya cant put it back in =-same goes for things said when in the heat of the moment (does more hurt than good)   life's too short so make the most of it; you only live but once.......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Absolutely wrong decision. You should first convert to Muslim and then get married. Thats a legal and humanitarian way to lead a successfull and prosperous life in this world and the hereafter. If you want to convert to Islam (which is a easiest thing in the world); you can call me 66568786 or you can go to Fanar. We are ready to help you. Remember; PEACE lies in TRUTH and surely ISLAM is religion of PEACE AND TRUTH !</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I agree with e46...park the car immediately. There can be several causes. If overheating; you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam. Do not just put water in the reservoir...you will need to use anti-freeze; but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out. If its greyish/blackish smoke; you're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve...both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario. Also; don't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>In case of black smoke; park your car; get out of the car n away frm it... and if its steamy kinda smoke; DO NOT do as novita sez... cuz if u open the radiator cap while its hot; u'll get a geyser kinda splash of hot water in your face n get burnt...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"QL will lose it's basic purpose I guess. In About QL they mention ""Participation is at the heart of our web site. We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar."" Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room; it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue; people will be too busy chatting in private. That's what I personally think anyway.

			<RelCText>Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there.to serve some sort of purpose; teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them; you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible; painful and unfair; but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential; strength; will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness; love; lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul. Without these small tests; life would be like a smoothly paved; straight; flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi I got my health card like 3 weeks ago in a Walk In Clinic; some where in Doha close to the souks; but I dont remember the address. U have to bring copy of your passport and Visa or Qatar Id with 100 Riyals; it take like 4 minutes once u are in the counter. but maybe it will be a 30 minutes line.

			<RelCText>Yeah; Shanky is correct. Just go to any of the PHCs. Carry a copy of ur id card; Electricity or telephone bill for the latest month and two photographs. Give it to the Lady on the counter together with the charge QR 100 for one year. She will issue one reciept and u can get ur card exactly after one month from the same counter. Don't go by weekends coz it will be rushy. It will be easier for u to go to the nearby PHC where ur staying.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have just had mine done last week. You need to go to your local clinic(one with green lollipops). Mornings only; go as early as possible; take: filled in form; 2 photos; copies of RP and passport; Karama bill; 100 QR for each person. It did not take me 5 minutes; more like 1 hour;(and 2 visits as I went in the afternoon the first time) you will be given a receipt which you can use instead of the card;the card will be issued after about 1 month.

Though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic! While i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club...do you think its own by Ramada Hotel? anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>i went tuesday; i thaught it was pretty poor tbh; lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s. the design is interesting; nothing like a propper nightclub; far too bright; no disco lighting; very restrictive about upstairs couples/vip area. it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies-pretty synthetic and fake. i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a Bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke; and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11.30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went on Thursday and had a good time with some friends. I thought the band was pretty good; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though. Everyone that had went before me summed it up as feeling like a warehouse and it's mostly due to the white walls I think. Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls. Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place. The ratio of guys to girls was about the same as everywhere else; 10 guys to 1 girl.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well if thats what you want to go to the Doha night clubs for then thats your deal. Night life in Qatar hmmmm is there such a thing? From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in. Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs; what makes them good and what makes them bad. Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them; in the case of Doha they will always be bad. Face facts if you got to a nightclub to pick up women (of any culture) then your not in to clubbing!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>To the majority of people whom have attended real clubs; go for the music; to get dressed up to impress not only others but themselves. Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex. Real clubbing....IS.... music; dancing not what has been described on here. This is not just my opinion; there are many clubbing web pages; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum. Have you ever been to Ibiza? granted the drug scene is far to prevalent there but it is all about fun music and dancing; not about picking up women!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I think it shouldn't be taken as just dance and drinks for nightlife. I suffer from lackness of cultural events in Doha. As I missed Anatolian Fire; Madame Butterfly under Asian Games events; I would like to see such entertaining performances more in Doha. Much more that if we can not find any place for one ; we can go for the other:D For example; there are some nice places making wonderful fruit cocktails; why not play bowling while you drink? A big complex with bowling; billiard; electronic games for adults strongly required... About Alaaddin's Kingdom;it is the only theme park with nothing! It should be more inviting...with some little theatre shows; animal shows; high quality electronic video games; good food; some recreation near sea... In Turkey; they make people to sit on camels for a little tour and take photograph; sorry I couldn't see any camels since I came here(9 months). About sea side; Doha has a wonderful corniche people just go and sit on grass; why there isn't some caf.....</RelCText>

The Jui-Jitsu class is breaking for Eid holiday and will be back first thing january (like in 10 days) there will be classes 6 days a week; 3 classes will be earlier times i am not sure yet its looking like 7:30-8:30pm S/T/R and the current class which is later 10pm-11pm M/W/S ; you can choose eithor or; or you can mix and match the days depending on when is best for you to attend and your schedule. All the other instructors have younger students so they cant let go of the earlier times to my class; thats why i got stuck with the later times; for some of my students they love it because they work in Ras Laffan and only get back in doha later at night.

			<RelCText>I have been doing martial arts for avery long time; and it started with traditional martial arts like Karate/Taekwondo i got black belts in both and was teaching a kids class in texas when i was in university; but then with the new wave of Ultimate fighting and MMA i switched to Muay Thai kickboxing and Brazilian Jui Jitsu; i have trained in them for almost fice years once this year is over. I even went to thailand and trained kickboxing there in the Fiartex camp i stayed there a long time basically life was training all day. I came across Krav Maga when i first started Jui Jitsu; there was a guy teaching it in town and it got alot of hype it was very effectively advertized in the united states and it attracted many people of the age-group 21years+ ; I think the organization made most of its money selling single women a false-sense of security in that if they learnt this they could take on any person in a dark parking lot.

I have been here for 15 years and I have not seen anything change with regards to the way Qatariâ€™s drive. Like MunozC Mentioned itâ€™s a downright attitude problem... They just think; I can drive in my country the way I like and get away with it; you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me. I have friends who have had skirmishes with these guys at times and they have insulted them and even gone to the extent of try to hit them when they have been proved wrong; right in front of the cops.

I drive fast when I know I have a clearing. I have seen people speed through compounds. I find it nice that when you're on a 2 lane road and there is a bit of a wait at the r/a; people make 4 lanes.

			<RelCText>It would be good if the Police (or traffic Police)first follow proper driving techniques/rules. ie: 1) hands free phone or preferable park and then speak on the phone. 2) follow speed limit. 3) not drive over footpath in private cruiser with uniform on. 4) immediate fine to anyone driving while holding the phone; or child on drivers lap; or driver with foot on the dashboard; or without seatbelt. 5) point system should be started in Qatar as most of the people breaking the law have the necessary funds. The list can go on. These are the ones I think need immediate attention. the first three points apply to the Police.</RelCText>

A majority of the deaths (36) occurred in the satellite township of Al Rayyan; followed by Madinat Khalifa (18) and Old Airport Area in Doha (05). At least 700 cases of road accidents were referred to the courts over the seven-month period.

			<RelCText>The Westbay CC area is pretty small; so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building. (maybe a dozen buildings) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available. Personally; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club. Al Farden Tower (where the BMW dealer is located) is very nice; but no balconies if that is important to you. 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors. The residences at the W Hotel are also quite nice; but no balconies.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Alyson; you can get Royal Canin for cats here; I always buy the hairball control at Doha Vets. If they don't have the specific for persians; they'll probably order it for you. I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that. If I may suggest; if you use an enclosed litter box; bring one with you; as they are very expensive here (QR250 for a really cheap looking one). Also bring toys; they are not easy to find here. And stuff like nail clipper as well. Oh; and frontline is also quite expensive here; and I haven't found the specific one for cats; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one. Anyway; those are the things you should know if you're bringing kittie with you.</RelCText>

I love exotic animals (I already have a tarantula; a wolf spider and lemur) If you know where I could get some piranha that would be awesome!

			<RelCText>Seen a pet shop near the Ramada; they had all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures; maybe they can help; not sure of the name of the road but you need to turn right by Hardees then follow the road until you see the Turkish restaurant on your right; the pet shop is opposite on the left. I cried though as they had abeautiful dog in a very small cage and it had been there a while :( wanted to take it home but wasn't allowed. Won't go again; too upsetting for me xx</RelCText>

			<RelCText>herne - obviously it's hard not to feel sorry for the animals in the pet shops; but the worst thing you can do is take pity and buy them because that will only exacerbate the problem; since it gives the shop owners a profit and the incentive to go and get more stock.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Body sugaring is a method for removing body hair that is a cheap; homemade alternative to waxing (or shaving). The theory behind body sugaring is that the hair is removed by the root; and when it grows back there will be less of it; and it will be softer and not stubbly as it is if a razor had been used. Body sugaring is done by making a paste of sugar; water; and lemon juice that has been heated to the softball candy stage. http://www.care2.com/greenliving/ancient-egyptian-body-sugaring.html# Sounds painful already......</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I came back from Europe last week with 2+ kilos in my checked bag - as did at least a dozen others on the same flight. Alcohol will be confiscated; no doubt about it; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner. I've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again. Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here. I'm a white Western middleaged female. Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point. Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident (in my 2+ years here).</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hello everyone; I have recently moved to Doha; i was based in the UAE before and whenever i wanted to buy cosmetics(make up) i would go to specific small shops to get them; the reason behind this was the price would be about 30% less than the perfumes in fancy stores at malls. And yes; the products were absolutely genuine. Sme brans i bought were estee lauder; loreal; bobbi brown. So; are there such shops in Doha too? If yes; please give me their location. Thank you.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>nomerci; Branded cosmetics (genuine) are not sold in any such small shops in Dubai and if so it could be a fake or counterfeit product as mentioned by you. I know the distributors in UAE and the Suppliers of all those Brands has got Offices in Dubai so there is no question of such items being sold in small shops. They are available only in the major shopping malls of UAE. All of them really cares the image.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You'd need an NOC (No objection certificate) if your company is not a government firm. Secondly; you would not need an NOC if you're here in Qatar on your husband's sponsorship.

			<RelCText>Leatherface; No i am not. Because i dont care where you working what you have done in your case. But if you are saying like this; i also have proove with me. One of my friend's sister who is working in one of private company and off course under its sponsorship. she got the car and changed the ownership of the car with out No objection letter. And this all process done by my self and her brother. First day we went and asked for the requirement and they said no need. And we have done this process in two days. Yes its quite possible may be at the time ownership; they are looking to company's name. May be from some companys they need this.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As you told it is your 2nd sponsor; it mean you transfor your old visa to the new sponsor; so i think he dont have any problem to give you release bcoz he did'nt buy your visa; he hired you localy; but even though everything is in his hand; most of the companies are not giving release; bcoz they bought visas and if they release it mean they are giving visa; but in your case you just transfor your visa to the new company; so i think if you request him when he is in good mood; i hope he'll deal you good; InshaAllah BEST OF LUCK</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if you walk on a plane while is moving as fast as speed of light than the time on a plane is slower than the time on earth.and even you walk inside of plan while it's in speed of light your speed will remain same as the plain b cuz of gravitational force it create inside of the plane wont allow you to walk or run more than the plan speed.even in that speed your clock will start to work slow than the earth time.so technically you are traveling to the future faster with the help of speed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>IN THE CASE FAMILY VISIT VISA; - marriage certificate or birth certificate need NOT to be attested. - NO need of Company Letter for each; only one letter but copy should be attached with each applications. - No need of Baladiya Stamp on Rental Agreement. Just to get a Rental Agreement from a Real Estate License holder. Try to prepare all the documents before you go to MOI. If one they rejected; it is very difficult to get it approved. Good Luck!</RelCText>

At Lulu; 3 or 4 produts from Shär are now available. I had contact with the rep.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As promised on my previous post; I'm very glad to inform you that gluten free bread can be ordered at the bakery corner of La Cigale Hotel. The pastry chef prepares white bread; pesto bread; tomato bread and thyme bread. He can also bake small sandwiches. He also offers delicious cookies. You will have to place your order one or two days in advance as this is a special preparation requesting a place and baking instruments completely free of gluten. We eat these breads since a few week and are very satisfied. Bon appetit</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can probably order your GF bread from La Cigale by phone but I think that; the 1st time; it is better to go to the bakery counter or to the casher. Try to get a phone contact or an email for the next orders. Sorry but I may not give you the contacts I got there... The price for a 1/2 kg bread is 50 QAR. It is not cheap but compared to the bread sold in Megamarkt; it is cheap AND better. You can contact me through this email adress : gf.jodemaere@spamgourmet.com !!! this address is a disposable address and will not work anymore after a short while.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have started cooking from scratch which is probably healthier but its time consuming with three different diets. In the UK you can buy wheat free; milk free and lactose free products.

			<RelCText>I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden). They may come out a little soft but will harden. Good luck!   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and ""Smart Balance"" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This works with any white fish fillets. It's particularly nice with parrot fish. Examine the fillets closely; and remove any scales and bones missed by the fishmonger. Fry some finely chopped onion until soft; then add crushed garlic; diced carrot and celery; with a little salt. Cover and sweat for five minutes. Add about 500mL vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetables are cooked. Remove the vegetables with a sieve; then cook the fish fillets in the simmering stock until the flesh has set (no more than 10 minutes). Serve the fish and vegetables with creamy mashed potato.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Take a whole Sherry; gutted and cleaned. Stuff the cavity with mix peppers; onions and garlic. coat the skin with thinly sliced lemon. Wrap in foil and stick it on the BBQ for 10 minutes. The fish will cook in it's own juices and the lemon stops the flesh from sticking to the foil :o) Did you Google it first?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"yes; the reason is that when the site is slow; which happens every now and then; the preview function makes it even more annoying and slow to post a comment. I don´t think it serves to any purpose. I never bother to re-read what I type and and roll down to press submit as quickly as possible... I don´t think that the preview function will stop some people from posting BS at times....I wonder how many members ""really"" preview their comments before posting?"</RelCText>

Just watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrEQaG5jPM They come to Doha used to driving and walking like this - no lanes; no rules; no traffic lights; and continue behaving exactly the same way on the streets of Doha. Can't wait for the police to enforce the new traffic rules..."</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Dear Rajeeb; Trust exchange of Qatar managed by State bank of India opens NRI account from Qatar. The required documents are. Passport copy; QID and visa page copy; two photos; and INR DD on your name (DD you can take from Trust exchange itself) then Trust exchange manager will sign the documents after verified. Once he signed you have send the documents by post to your nearst branch in India. After 15- 25 days you will get passbook; chq book and ATM card and all. Hope this answer would help in your question.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>According to my experience; open NRI direct account with commercial Bank &amp; ICICI bank; this gives you current account in commercial bank; NRE account in ICICI bank &amp; if you are interested in Share/mutual fund online trading then ICICI online trading account facility is best. you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your ICICI NRE account online &amp; transfer happens in one working day. Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer; Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank; so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account &amp; This transfer is also fast; most of the time one working day.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Gentlman ; Go for SBI NRE account ; safe ; secure &amp; reliable .They have online banking with all good feature like saving account with international debit card; demat ; bill payment and fund transfer through NEFT/RTGS ; 24x7 toll free customer support etc.. Gone were the days when we used to look for banks in Qatar with a tie up with Indian banks . Now with E remittance facility you can quickly transfer fund to almost all banks in India . Have a nice weekend !</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My experience with Doha Bank-Axis bank for the past 3 years has been very satisfactory. The transfers online occur instantly most of the time and the rates offered by Doha bank are the best in here compared to all other banks and the exchange houses. The customer service by Axis bank in India ( at least in Kochi; Kerala) is excellent. I do have an SBI NRE account but I still would prefer remittances done to Axis bank as the money gets credited to Axis bank accounts much faster than to SBI accounts.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks; this will create a problem for your sponsor. In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems; it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Well I think it’s a rip off. No such thing as the best bank. I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with. With QNB; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3;000 in your current account always. It’s a compulsory savings scheme. Plus; you get .25% in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5%. Be careful; read the small prints. I don't trust banks here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You'll hv to get a letter from your company stating your salary terms and allowances - they'll immediately give you a new account; ATM card along with a PIN; Credit Card and Cheque book (depends on the type of account). Ofcourse you'll hv to submit your RP (once obtained) details in a months time else they'll have to close the account So Basically you can open you account and have your ATM/Credit Card (as well as their PIN numbers) in 10 mins.The best facility i've seen in this region.The only thing i'm not happy about is their QR 5;000 average balance to be maintained.Tht is a bit too much cash to have locked.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Places have been filled by now and waiting lists will have been updated. Schools are not back now until beginning of September (by that I mean school offices) and I am almost sure that whatever school you pick; you will be placed on the waiting list. Have a look at schools suitable to your 'requirements'; but be aware that the more waiting lists you join; the better chance you have to get a place. But first you need to get here as no school will give you a chance to even join the waiting list if you are not physically in Qatar.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>This is really late to be trying to find a place for September; try and get his name into as many schools as you're interested in ASAP - There is the ASD; DESS and Doha College which are all probably considered to be the best - but because they are good - their waiting lists can be long. Some have recommended Compass or Sherbourne as well. Do a little googling to see about facilities and contact info - then start communicating with them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>get her to rule out any medical condition first for being overweight...always related to hormones.....u say she has been overweight for a few months...pls get it checked. if there is a hormonal imbalance u will put on weight....then you put on more weight and the hormonal imbalance keeps on...its a vicious cycle.... exercise n proper diet...which means low fats and meals ateast 5 times a day...but small meals. how long does she exercise.......u need to really workout max of 80mins to bring about weight loss....new study...... keep a target of 3 months to see some proper weight loss and u have to keep at it. i dont know of xenical...have heard of actrim which is fruit extracts. happy heart drive safe cos someone is waiting for u at home</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Xenical seperates the fats from the foods that you eat. It teaches you to eat healthy foods that are low in fat. Of course; the fats that are seperated have to come out somehow and I'm sure you can guess how they come out. It's not a pretty picture. Some friends of mine were taking this and quit taking it within the month. They did lost some weight but the ""accidents"" were not worth it I guess.

			<RelCText>I have heard from lots of people that Herbalife works really well as long as you do not eat greasy food. I have never been fat so I would not know; but I know a few guys who swear by it. ANy of you out there who can relate to my comment that Herbalife works; I think if you can say it works it might be a good way to lose weight. Anyway when compared to pills I think shakes are better and also gives you a chance to forget about meals and still have your required protien; carb and vitamin intake.... --------------------------------------------------- Live Free and Die</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"for banks to reduce their interest rates per QCB's circular. No ifs or buts. The QCB is the governing body of banks. Wikipedia: ""...The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply; but more active duties include controlling interest rates (i.e.; price fixing ); and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of financial crisis (e.g.; bailouts ). It may also have supervisory powers; intended to prevent banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behaviour. Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference."" If your bank has not reduced its interest rates; then they fall under 'fraudalent behaviour'; which would make them liable."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes!!! There was a circular was issued 4-months ago. QCB is allowing banks to charge a maximum interest of 5% per annum and it is a retroactive implementation where the loan shall be re-calculated front and back. Was planning to pay my remaining loan and I learned to know that their computation will be based on the original interest rate when loan was taken. In fact; loan agreement is based on floating rate. This new interest rate are now being implemented by other banks; except HSBC>>>>></RelCText>

			<RelCText>typically here the interest on Vehicles are almost identical with small differences no more than 1/2 percentile. On personal loans; I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them. Banking here is different from the west. when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks (you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it). some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose. Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however; personal loans take more time (at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly) before it is approved. Here; there is no credit history that you can transfer with you. it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you. Bottom line; don't bother with researching any oth.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ with no doubt. Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service. CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online; call center. (I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank) IBQ doesn't have online service at all. Network; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls (Hyatt; Villagio; city center; lulu HM; Landmark) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours. Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank. I'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well. They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks (and I have dealt with many of them)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ is the best; I have accounts in QNB; Standard Chartered &amp; Doha Bank. Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff. They have a excellent telephone manners. Doha bank call center very poor; I always feel like I'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know. Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem. Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center. They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account. Only one time I receive sms from them. QNB is one of the worst; I've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it's nothing. What's funny with this guy; he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happened anymore. How disgusting!. http://www.lizaqat.blogspot.com</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Increased Interest rates on exsisting loans</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Has anybody else noticed this? I bank with Doha Bank and have a personal loan. I've just realised that they have increased the interest rate by 2% sometime in the last 2-3 months without even bothering to inform me. A phonecall to the bank has proved useless as usual. I'm off to the bank now in person; lets see what happens. I'd be on the lookout if you do bank with them.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Just an update.... I do have a fixed rate loan apparently it means nothing to them. I should feel better that this change is across the board; 'for everybody; new and exsisting loans'(in case I felt left out; I suppose). What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank (???) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down. I don't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom!!! Also regarding not informing me about the increase....'we have 1000's of customers we can't tell everybody!' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what's the excuse for not sending an email or text? Anyway long story short; I'm moving banks and am very glad to; good riddance to old rubbish. I do wish I could meet the people who gave them all those awards for 'Excellence in banking' etc we must not be talking about the same Doha Bank. Goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Vegas... re-read the post; nothing to do with late payment; just a general across-the-board increase in interest rates. Basically the bank trying to squeeze every penny out of people (especially those who have being paying on time; because this would mean they have the money; no use trying to get money out of someone who doesn't have it)to cover any losses they may have sustained while 'playing' the markets.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Casanova; I'm sorry to disappoint you with this; HSBC is just like any other bank in Doha; and it's even worse because they charge for every thing. Don't be amused by this word (The World's Local Bank); they are right in it's local; but it's not universal. you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide; they will tell you: sorry; there is no networks between our banks in the world; so it's just local bank. I'm telling you this; since I'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar; and HSBC was even lower level than others; it's just a big name; the only good thing about them; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street. I think Doha; Almashreq; and the commercial banks are better options. Best regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need; you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply; just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things; which are not in Qatar; from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff; you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too; like car and petrol.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you're shipping a container over from the uk then my advise would be to bring E V E R Y T H I N G and more :) It's painful to pay 3 if not 4 times as you would back home. Wipes are ripoff. I bought almost everything for my kids in the uk but my husband (aaargh) dissuaded me from buying the next size up car seat for my son that would have costed me £110-£120 from mothercare/halfords but it costs £260 in mc here. needless to say i'll wait til januari when the inlaws are coming....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Amadeo; Sharjah to Dubai is really just 25 minutes travel by car if there is no traffic at the National Paint area. Traffic starts from 7 to 9am and from 5 to 8pm during week days. There is a short cut to avoid traffic if the driver knows it. But I don't suggest the OP to go for Air Arabia as it has only slight difference with the air ticket rates compared with the Fly Dubai. Sometimes; FlyDubai is even cheaper (if you dont have baggage to check-in) and it is convenience to any means of transportation...you can take bus; taxi or metro.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>heloo2020; Chances of you getting a job there now are very slim. I don’t think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right; but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads). If you have a family to take care of; perhaps it would be wiser not to take risks when you have little chances to succeed. Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation. Good luck!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i was a little hesitant whether to express my thoughts; becaue it may be discouraging statement for helooo2020. For Indians; getting a Canadaian visa is like somethig like jackpot.

			<RelCText>I have seen numerous cases of people getting Canadian visas and having no intention to work there. They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport). So; it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are. I would go with Baldricl's suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign. perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider taking you back in six months time if needed. Good luck anyway :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I went to Thailand for 3 weeks at Christmas/New Year and visited a few different places; but if you only have 5 days then you'll probably only be able to do one place. Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that's where you're flying to/from; and it has plenty to do for 5 days. The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do; but I can give you more specific ideas if you want. We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely. Still a city with lots to see in and around it; but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok. If you fancy proper chilling then I'd recommend down south. We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta (north and south of Phuket respectively). Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I'm led to believe Phuket is. </RelCText>

			<RelCText>Use the above sites or Asia Web Direct website (search on Google) to find our info on the hotel you would like to stay at. These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures. Once you have identified the hotel you would like to stay in; search for the hotel name on google and book the rooms from the hotel website. Majority of hotels offer best rates available in the market thru their own website. Makes sense as they save on commission or brokerage charges from third party websites. ---------------------- 3000 QL Points Way to go Ray! ----------------------</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Sri Lanka is a beautiful place to visit. If you go to SriLankan Airlines office that is at Al-SAAD; you will be able to find some package for Qr 5000 (including airfare).

			<RelCText>Why not try somewhere totally exotic in South East Asia. Thailand; Vietnam; or Malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget travellers. Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3;000 to Thailand; you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air; leaving you QR 2;000 for hotels etc. Take a look at Air Asia's web site. It is SE Asia's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too. If time is not an issue you can also take the bus from say Malaysia to Thailand; or Thailand to Vietnam or Cambodia. Best of luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd. Just watch out for the following characteristics. a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look); which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in; but none would touch it. I wonder why? b) b) The females will almost always have flowing; shiny; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes; the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices. c) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"The other day; i met one of the most senior members of QL - Darude. Each time he shook hands with a person; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing ""cuckoo; cuckoo"". I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two. I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard. I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon. Note to self: Give birds Residence permit; land cruiser allowance; two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I don't know if it's a waste of time but I DO find it confusing. Hub gets Friday off and Saturday AFTERNOON ??? What's that all about! Really cuts into the 'break' and means Friday evening out is a 'no no'. I think they use Saturday morning to hold meetings to catch up on events; but I often forget it's a half day and get a surprise (pleasant) when hub suddenly appears home around 1.00 p.m. or earlier. Anywhere else I've lived in the Middle East the week end has been Thursday and Friday with; maybe; Thursday afternoon as well as Friday being the time off.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi;Canadian Luda Moving to Qatar in mid-August is a no no.But if you have no choice...Why do I say that??Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it. Regarding the shipment;there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here(house-holds;china;etc)at a reasonable price. Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is. What to expect when you arrive??hhhmm...difficult question.A lot of dust;heat and a lot of humidity :) I don't know how much you know about Qatar.But if you have any questions just let me know.

			<RelCText>tough time to move. I moved in August as well. but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on. Quick addition: I do suggest you actually move with stuff... especially if you and your partner are doing this together. clothing is expensive here and if it's just 'your own stuff' that you want around the house; pack a few boxes of clothes you want; pics; music or books or whatever. everything retail and consumable is expensive. As for a moving company.... I've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place. Visa stuff... let the employer take are of that. I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents (birth certs; marriage certs; etc.)... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them. Plus; if you can even get one of each certified by the Qatar consulate in Canada before you go (yo.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>yup....u've got a point there about westerners not listening to asian music....but the channel is not going to cater only to QL members;y'see.it's for the entire country!think of all those constructions workers out there (a vast majority of whom are asians) who could plug their ears with a pair of earphones connected to their mobiles(i'm sure almost all mobiles today have an inbuilt FM system)and work!they have no penchant for english music as many of them do not understand the language.listening to music from their countries will definitely make them feel a wee bit less homesick at least!and for all those people from the west;there's always QBS!:-) Take care Raakhee</RelCText>

			<RelCText>It would be awesome if we had our own Hindi channel. I am a Pakistani but I love hindi movies and music. I do listen to radio 4 FM 89.1 and city FM 101.6 but we do not get them all year round. Only when the weather is calm and not windy. We don't get it all during the winter. It is a very good suggestion and I do believe Qatar should have its own 24 hour hindi FM channel. If we can have 24 hour English channel on FM 97.5 for the last 30 plus years in Qatar then why not a Hindi channel????</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Most countries require you to have at least 6 months remaining on your passport before they will allow you to enter. I had the same problem as you whilst living in Panama. I am a resident there but with a UK passport. I was going on a 2 day business trip to Mexico and had to renew my passport before I left Panama.

			<RelCText>I dont think it is necessary to have 6 months validity while you hold a valid Residence Permit. 6 months validity of a PP is required if you are travelling to a country without having a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you does not have 6 months valid Passport as well. In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left. You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble. So play safe.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Brit; I might have to disagree with you on this one. Cost of living in home countries? I can assure you that in India; some people have a REALLY high cost of living. Like anywhere else; you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive. Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle. Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it. Plus; if someone is living here; who cares how much a soda can costs back home? Why can't that person Mr (kumar) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr (John) does with his family? I bet you Mr kumar's kids and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while. I am glad I am white. But nothing pisses me off more than Racism and especially when it gets acknowledged by those who benefit from it! :) you know better brit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Also BE; having worked in HR here for a while; it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that. For instance; 2 Civil Engineers; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR (in their home country). HR will base their offer on how much extra (or not) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn. So you can't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you cannot offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home. Also back to BE's point; rents; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america. And lastly for those that say why not hire all from India etc because there is nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>what are we here for but to save for a better life when we go home. If someone cannot save for a better life when they go home; will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work; so they have to pay more for a mix of people. However; what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while; their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change; voila; their salaries go up. What I also notice is that alot of westerners; their salaries do not change much; they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and cannot get much higher by changing jobs.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Help!! How to stop severe hair fall</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I know this topic has been beaten to a pulp; so to speak. But my problem is not Male Pattern Baldness (Alopecia) which is genetic and can't be stopped; for now. I'm starting to lose much more than the normal amount of hair that falls every day. Does anyone out there know or is using some home remedy to stop hair fall? Please share. I'm worried that if it continues; it will result to something like this:</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Not too sure what a Cisco certified Network Engineer can do for an organisation. My limited knowledge of these devices indicates to me that your work would be quite repetitiouis and mundane; requiring long hours. QR10k seems a little low to live in Qatar where basic foodstuffs are expensive and of poor quality. Personally; if I couldn't be happy with my renumeration knowing I was on a good deal; I'd go home.

			<RelCText>"what kind of Cisco certifications you have ; average salary for CCNP is 18000 minimum as basic ; accomodation should not be less than 6000 for single ; transportation should not be less than 2000 ; so minimum total salary should not less than 26000 for person with 4 years and CCNP certified to be able to live in that high cost country. for government section it is higher than that ; can reach 30K to 32K. my advise is ""Think well before comming qatar"".

And the arrangement could be innocent; purely for financial reasons. But in the eyes of Sharia law you are committing an offence. More and more people are being punished because they claim they were unaware of the law and its clauses. There are hundreds of cases such as these that emerge each year either from the police or the courts. An increasing number of men and women; who are not blood relatives nor legally married; and have shared a flat; room or even sat in tinted cars; are being jailed and deported; a lawyer said. These men and women have shared no relationship. Dr Adel Khamis Al Mimari from Al Itazan Consultant and Advocates said they are being punished in accordance with Sharia law.

			<RelCText>compu - the answer to your question is: it doesn't make any difference. it is illegal for people of different sexes who are not related (marriage / family) to share accommodation ;o) by the way... why would a woman want to live with a guy without getting married? - she's missing out on a ring and other perks that wifes get! - she still does all the work that a wife would; again... without the perks that wife would have - and finally there is this risk she'd take here... ... plus a guy will no see a reason to marry her since she's already doing the job! ha ha ha just being cheeky ;o)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes friend you can; somebody think that she have to change her religion to muslim; that is not true ; as she is a Christian lady; she can worship the God as per Christian instructions; and Islam religion respect other religion specially christian ; so no problem at all.the verse versa is prohibited ; but if a muslim lady wants to married a christian man ; not allowed and everybody know the reason. Go ahead ; enjoy life ; and count from 1 to 10 while you ask this question: can I control my kids believing in future? what is her attitude when you get up early to prey alfajr; what type of food you will share together ; what about Ramadan fasting ....so many questions. and the most importent question : why you fail to find an Egyption lady ?

			<RelCText>well; we don't celebrate Eid Al-Fitr the same way u celebrate Christmas; so you won't find fireworks in most countries. mostly it's about family gathering; having lunch together; and going out in groups I guess. As for Doha; it's gonna be my first Eid here; so I'll just wait and see how it will be... :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If your comment is based on what I have posted; please do not get me wrong; I do not know if they will have fireworks or not; it is just that these fireworks are arranged by the govt. and what appeared in the papers was that this time the govt has not arranged any festivites for this eid due to the run up to the asian games.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There are two factors that will determine your success in quitting smoking for good. They are: 1.Will - You must have the desire to give up your habit of smoking and create a strong will to avoid a smoking relapse. 2.Mindset – You must learn about the effects of smoking; understand its consequences and face the fact that you need to stop smoking and follow; finish and maintain a quit smoking plan.

			<RelCText>1. Keep something warm between your fingers whenever you feel smoking 2. If you are working in a high riser; walk down the stairs for smoking and walk up the stairs on the way back. you will feel rather not walk and automatically not smoke. 3. Have a hot cup of green tea 4. When ever you get an urge to smoke indulge in something that you like doing.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My Frnd; The basic failure to quit smoking is firmness. People wants to quit smoking not because they wish; but because it is injures to health. If you really wish from your bottom of heart; then chances to quit smoking is more. But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason; then you may really need more efforts. I wish you success. Does the QL members agree on the aove point.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>To answer your question; I have seen the patches at the pharmacies around Doha. I would like to be able to get Champix/Chantix; the quit smoking pill. Many of my family have taken it and quit completely. It blocks your craving for nicotine and you no longer want or need to smoke. I have asked many times if it is available here and never got an answer.</RelCText>

I tried sometimes to quit but usually they are either due to my girlfriend nagging or jus trying. Usually even with success on stopping for a week; I resume again; sometimes 3 months and picked up the habit. You will have to decide and discipline yourself. Even a puff.... From what I can remember; I used a combination of sub-concious method:- 1) I do not stick with one brand of cigarette switch around also between heavy and light ones but toward light ones more. And I by when I finish...never maintain a backup pack or reach from friends. (this has impact; I noticed almost immediately I hate the different brands and sometime even dislike the brand this is good cos you are still holding the cigarette but smoke less as you ""hate""d the taste) 2) Started some simple exercise like jogging or any sports (good preparation to clear yo....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Dear Friend; First of all let me tell you that there is nothing wihich can stop you from smoking other than your WILL TO GIVE UP SMOKING. You need to first understand what is the thing which make you smoke. 1. your mindset : It wants support! support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension / stress / anger etc. In case of smokers its ""smoking"" So you have to build your own support mechnism : like Music (which ever you like) any physical activiy like cycling; exercise; playing tennis ; football; swimming anything...and that u only can identify. 2. Nicotine Cycle / Levels of Nicotine in blood: This is the nicotine content in the blood which gets lowered and bue to which the necotine which is absorbed by your lungs enters into your blood through your lungs (alveolies) and carried into the blood stream through arteries to Heart and pumped to Brain through arteries. this whole process is called as Nicotine cycle.

			<RelCText>"Its actually surprisingly EASY if you WANT to stop smoking!! I quit after nearly 23 years of smoking when I found out that I was pregnant. Years and years of my family nagging me; bribing me; beggin me ... always the fear of the ""side effects"" if I had to quit and the hard headed insistance that I liked smoking and it was my outlet from stress and yabba yabba ... I was honestly pissed off with myself when I did stop and the truth hit home how much damage I had done to myself and to my relationships for so long and all FOR NOTHING!! There was no cold turkey; no shakes; no cough; no sudden uncontrollable energy; no sudden weight gain; etc. etc. What did happen? Anxiety and stress LEFT!! And the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it became more repulsive than ever. And I suddenly was open to socialising with people that didn't smoke! It was actually annoyingly easy to stay quit! Didn't need Zyban; nicorettes; mouth spray or anything. I had started reading Alan Carr's book ""The Easy Way....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I quit two years ago. Was quite tough. I used nicotine chewing gums for first few days. I still dream of smoking and feel I am just a millimeter (or a puff)away from being an addict again. Don't allow yourself even a single puff for me. Stay away from ambience which makes you feel like smoking. Quit one hundred percent. Don't give any concessions to yourself; be ruthless. Positives of quitting far outweigh the negatives. I did gain weight but reduced it as I could execise better now. Smoking anyway is outlawed almost everywhere. It's out of fashion too. I don't blame my previous generation for glorifying it as they did know less about the harms. If someone picks up the habit now or still continues with it then he or she definitely is an ignorant person. It makes you sick and smelly.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Ok Dr. SMOKE is in the house. Fireheartin; look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole ""giving up"". What are you going to gain by giving up smoking? Live healthier? Live longer? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself. Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking. Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better. 2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke; you'll be looked as that ""loser"" guy. Your not a loser when you smoke; you make MORE friends when you smoke. Imagine your Boss walks up to you one day and asks you for a light and you say ""sorry i dont smoke; i've given up smoking as it....."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>fireheartin.. smoking patches available in most pharmacies. Nothing will help you quit smoking but yourself. I was a smoker 5+ years ago.. Here are my experiences: 1- I use to smoke 1 packet a day and reduced gradually to 4 cigs a day hoping that I will break free. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 2- Tried smoking patches. It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 3- Determination. When I use to smoke; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work; i make my car smelling cigarrets; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!! You have to convince yourself that you must stop. Don't fool urself thinking u r addicted and cannot stop. It is an addiction but you can live normally without it. I stopped smoking suddenly without issues. When you sto.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP; Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000); so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar.

			<RelCText>coming from australia; we're big BBQ'ing ppl. most bbq's here are coal/brickettes. they come in all sizes and many ppl have little compact ones that get used when taken on days out to the beach. we have chosen to go with as there was our concern with storing gas bottles during the summer. we didnt want to leave a gas bottle inside our villa while were away for most of the summer months and not have the air conditioner on. having said that; carrefour does sell a good range of gas bbq's as well; big 4-5 burner ones or that have wok burners too. happy bbq'ing and as we say in australia 'i'll throw another shrimp in the barbie for ya!'</RelCText>

			<RelCText>briquettes are widely available as are a variety of makes and models of charcoal bbqs. I would say good gas grills are expensive compared to Canada; the US and Australia but are becoming more available. As for compatibility; I have the charcoal grill (all I need is lighter fluid) but I understand there are serious issues with North American gas grill compatibility but someone else would have to speak to the specifics.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Bring it with you. We purchased one from Lowes and had it shipped unassembled (still in the box) and don't regret it one bit. I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm. You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive. The canisters are larger in Doha than they are in the U.S.; so don't count on the tank fitting under your grill.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop &amp; Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20; which is much faster and secure. if you are buying from other countries like US; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post; its take a month too; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140. alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL; or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. don't buy too famous brands. they are not offering anything extra 2. look for the best configuration that suits your needs. 3. Personally i recommend Dell; Lenovo; Acer and Asus. 4. Depending on your budget you should look for the best options. At the moment the best configurations that don't cost that much are core i5 Second Generation; 4 GB ram; 500+ GB Hard-Drive; 15.6 inch screen. The graphic card is a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation has a pretty good integrated graphics (basically the better the CPU the better the graphics performance). So at this time i would recommend: Dell inspiron 15r: i5 SG; 500GB; 4 GB RAM; GT525M - 1GB graphic memory - this was bought by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300QR. Something cheaper than that: Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance. They are using some old CPU's brought back to life by the Second Generation from Intel (like Celeron). This i have right now: Acer Aspire 5349: Celeron b800 (.....</RelCText>

			<RelCText>listen; if your gaming is your top priority ; then u must prepare a good budget for it; i'd reccomend an alienware m15x but its a bit more expensive than laptops in carefour(they stink for gaming actualy) so buy a : 2gb ram(dont worry u dont need more than that) 2.5ghz core 2 duo proccessor nvidia 9800m gt 512 mb and dont worry about running heavy games (gow;cod4.ut3....etc) on it ;it will work at max res and highest settings.... anyways its for 8000 qr but its worth it</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is a cheap but with good quality laptop in Jarir. Fujitsu Amilo with external graphic booster. It's really design for gaming.Well; if you are concern with budget only. But it would be better if you will get a desktop instead. Fujitsu Amilo SA3650 AMD Turion ZM-86 2.4GHz 4GB RAM 500 GB HDD</RelCText>

			<RelCText>"Actually u should specify what r u looking for in a labtop Quality: Sony or Fujitsu Siemens Price: I dont really know Efficiency: Dell High Spec.: HP me (TAMUQ student) and my father (senior computer coder or progammer; u name it) are working on HPs I have a 64-bit quad core 3.6ghz processor (which I have never heard anyone seen it before; and a 640gb disk with a 17"" touch screen (thats a labtop not a desktop) I baught last summer for about 7 8 thousand QRs; my father's is even better; same speed and ram and everything; but the capacity is 2tb; he baught it from Russia. But; HP has a problem of a lil bit unstability; no; thats not the word; I dont know what it is. the thing is that although its way too fast and so advanced; I didnt feel its speed; I have the 1530 Dell (my sister's) and compared to mine and dad's; its so down in the specs and I really enjoy how fast it goes; so thats the differency; efficiency and High specs; so its ur call. I would say go for HP."</RelCText>

			<RelCText>All of them are actually the best that's why they made it to the market but if you will ask what are the specifications you need for certain laptop that is another thing.

The one i prefer is Fujitsu Siemens ""Made in Germany"" i like it a lot .. but also like lance12 has told u .. it depends on what is the purpose of buying a laptop .. that will let us give u the suitable specifications and u can search among the brands to find the best one and suitable price for u .. ================================================ http://www.showcaseyourmusic.com/LittleGuitarist ""Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.""

			<RelCText>Sony VAIO is the best as it is built around a Blue Ray Disk drive; one that can write 25Gb of data on a DVD. BD Drives have better visual &amp; audio capability than HD Drives. followed by Toshiba's Qosimos series. 3rd is Apple. Strangly apple does not talk about HD-drives or BD-drives!

			<RelCText>When you buy it; make sure the warranty is global or worldwide. Atif242; yes you don't have to pay tax when you buy the item; but tax was paid on the item when it was imported to Qatar and that is definitely passed down to you in the form of retail price. Might be a little cheaper in the UK because they probably import in huge quantities unlike Qatar. But none can beat laptop prices in the US :-)</RelCText>
